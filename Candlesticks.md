# Candlestick Patterns

This is the central hub for understanding Japanese Candlestick patterns. Each pattern tells a story about the battle between the bulls and the bears. Understanding these stories is the key to anticipating market movements.

This library is organized first by **Relevance** (Major vs. Secondary/Nuanced) and then by the **Number of Candles** in the pattern. This structure allows you to prioritize the most powerful signals while still having a complete reference.
