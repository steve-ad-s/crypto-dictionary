# Rising Three Methods

![[Rising Three Methods (Bullish Continuation).jpg]]

This is a **MAJOR** bullish continuation pattern that occurs in an uptrend, signaling a pause for breath before the bulls resume their charge.

## Relevance & Type

- **Relevance:** Major
- **Type:** Five-Candle Bullish Continuation

## Description

The Rising Three Methods pattern consists of five candles and tells a story of a temporary pullback that is ultimately overcome by the prevailing trend.

1.  **First Candle:** A long white/green candle appears in a clear uptrend, showing strong buying pressure.
2.  **Three Middle Candles:** A series of three small-bodied black/red candles follows. These candles trade within the range of the first candle's high and low. They represent a period of profit-taking or minor consolidation, but the selling is not strong enough to push the price below the first candle's low.
3.  **Fifth Candle:** A final long white/green candle that opens above the close of the last small candle and closes at a new high, above the close of the first candle.

## Interpretation

The pattern shows that despite a three-day pullback, the bears lacked the conviction to reverse the trend. The original bullish sentiment remains intact, and the final powerful white candle confirms that the bulls have reasserted control and are ready to drive prices higher. It is a sign of a healthy and resilient uptrend.

- **Confirmation:** The close of the fifth candle above the high of the first candle is the confirmation.
- **Volume:** Ideally, volume should decrease during the three small bearish candles and increase on the final bullish candle.

## Conditions

1.  A clear uptrend must be in progress.
2.  The first candle is a long bullish candle.
3.  The next three candles are small-bodied bearish candles that remain within the range of the first candle.
4.  The fifth candle is a long bullish candle that closes at a new high, above the close of the first candle.

## Relationship - Candlestick

- **[[Falling Three Methods]]:** This is the direct bearish counterpart, signaling a continuation of a downtrend.
- **[[Mat Hold]]:** This is a more powerful bullish variation of the Rising Three Methods. The Mat Hold also has a consolidation period, but it typically begins with a gap up, showing even greater bullish conviction.
