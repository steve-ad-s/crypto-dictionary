# Dark Cloud Cover

![[dark_cloud_cover.png]]

The Dark Cloud Cover is a two-candle bearish reversal pattern that appears at the top of an uptrend. It indicates a potential shift in momentum from buyers to sellers and warns of a possible price decline.

## Logical Behavior

This pattern tells a story of a failed rally and a significant comeback by the sellers.

1.  **First Candle (Bullish):** The first candle is a long bullish (white/green) candle, which confirms that the uptrend is still active and buyers are in control.
2.  **Second Candle (Bearish):** The second candle is a long bearish (black/red) candle. It opens with a gap up, above the high of the previous day, which initially appears bullish. However, sellers then take control and push the price down, causing the candle to close more than halfway down the body of the first bullish candle.

This price action shows that despite a strong bullish open, sellers overwhelmed the buyers and managed to erase a substantial portion of the previous day's gains. This failure to sustain the new highs is a significant sign of weakness.

- **Confirmation:** A bearish candle on the following day that closes lower than the second candle of the pattern provides strong confirmation of the reversal.
- **Volume:** The pattern is more reliable if there is high volume on the second, bearish candle, as it shows strong conviction from the sellers.
- **With other indicators:** The Dark Cloud Cover is more potent when it forms at a major resistance level or when an oscillator, such as the RSI, is in an overbought condition.

## Conditions

1.  **A clear uptrend must be in progress.**
2.  **The first candle is a strong bullish candle.**
3.  **The second candle is a strong bearish candle.**
4.  The second candle must open above the high of the first candle.
5.  The second candle must close below the midpoint of the first candle's body.

## Relationship - Candlestick

The Dark Cloud Cover is a classic bearish reversal signal and has important relationships with other patterns.

- **Piercing Pattern:** This is the direct bullish counterpart to the Dark Cloud Cover. The [[PiercingPattern]] appears at the bottom of a downtrend and signals a potential bullish reversal.
- **Bearish Engulfing Pattern:** The Dark Cloud Cover is similar to the [[BearishEngulfingPattern]] but is considered slightly less powerful. In an Engulfing pattern, the second candle completely envelops the body of the first, showing a more decisive and violent takeover by the sellers.
- **On Neck Line / In Neck Line / Thrusting Line:** These are similar two-candle patterns that can appear in an uptrend. However, in these patterns, the second bearish candle fails to close below the midpoint of the first candle, showing a much weaker selling response. They are often considered bullish continuation patterns, unlike the Dark Cloud Cover.
