# Gravestone Doji

![[Figure 3.21 - Gravestone Doji.png]]

The Gravestone Doji is a specific and powerful type of [[Doji]] that acts as a single-candle bearish reversal pattern, especially when it appears at the top of an uptrend.

## Relevance & Type

- **Relevance:** Major
- **Type:** Single-Candle Bearish Reversal

## Logical Behavior

The Gravestone Doji tells a story of a fierce battle within a single trading session where the bears emerge as the clear victors. The long upper shadow shows that after the market opened, buyers pushed the price significantly higher. However, this rally was met with overwhelming selling pressure, which drove the price all the way back down to close at the opening price. This represents a powerful rejection of higher prices and indicates that sellers have taken control from the buyers.

- **At the top of an uptrend:** A Gravestone Doji is a strong signal of a potential top and an impending bearish reversal. It suggests the buying climax has been met with a wave of selling.
- **Confirmation is recommended:** Despite being a strong signal, it is prudent to wait for bearish confirmation. A subsequent candle that closes below the Gravestone's low provides strong validation of the reversal.
- **Volume:** High volume on the Gravestone Doji candle reinforces its significance. It indicates that the struggle at the highs was intense and the sellers' victory was decisive.
- **With other indicators:** The pattern is most reliable when it forms at a major resistance level, a trendline, or when an oscillator like the RSI is in an overbought condition.

## Conditions

1.  **Open, Low, and Close are the same:** The candle should have no real body.
2.  **Long upper shadow:** There must be a long upper shadow, reflecting the failed rally.
3.  **No lower shadow:** There should be no, or a very negligible, lower shadow.
4.  **Preceding uptrend:** For the Gravestone Doji to be a valid bearish reversal signal, it must appear after a period of buying.

## Relationship - Candlestick

The Gravestone Doji is a specialized and potent version of a standard Doji.

- **Doji:** It is a specific type of [[Doji]], but it carries a much stronger bearish bias than a standard, neutral Doji.
- **Dragonfly Doji:** This is the direct bullish opposite of a Gravestone Doji. The [[DragonflyDoji]] has a long lower shadow and is a bullish reversal signal. They are perfect mirror images in both form and meaning.
- **Shooting Star:** A [[ShootingStar]] is very similar in interpretation to a Gravestone Doji. Both are bearish reversal patterns with long upper shadows. The main difference is that a Shooting Star has a small real body, while a Gravestone Doji has none. The Gravestone is often considered a more powerful and decisive signal.
- **Confirmation Patterns:** After a Gravestone Doji, a strong bearish pattern like [[ThreeBlackCrows]] or a [[BearishEngulfingPattern]] would provide powerful confirmation of the new downtrend.
