# Bullish Harami

![[Figure 3.26 - Bullish Harami.png]]

The Bullish Harami is a two-candle bullish reversal pattern that appears at the bottom of a downtrend. "Harami" is an old Japanese word for "pregnant."

## Relevance & Type

- **Relevance:** Major
- **Type:** Double-Candle Bullish Reversal

## Logical Behavior

The Harami pattern tells a story of a potential trend reversal due to a sudden decrease in momentum.

1.  **First Candle (Bearish):** The first candle is a long bearish (black/red) candle, which shows that the sellers are still in control of the market.
2.  **Second Candle (Bullish):** The second candle is a small bullish (white/green) candle whose body is completely contained within the body of the first candle.

The small body of the second candle indicates a sudden drop in momentum and a period of indecision. After a strong sell-off on the first day, the market opens and trades within a much smaller range, suggesting that the selling pressure is abating. It's a potential sign that the trend is running out of steam.

- **Confirmation:** The Bullish Harami is a pattern that absolutely requires confirmation. The signal is confirmed if the next candle is a bullish candle that closes above the high of the first, large bearish candle.
- **Volume:** Some traders look for volume to diminish on the second candle, reinforcing the idea of a trend that is losing its power.
- **With other indicators:** The pattern is more reliable when it forms at a significant support level or when oscillators are showing oversold conditions.

## Conditions

1.  **A clear downtrend must be in progress.**
2.  **The first candle is a long bearish candle.**
3.  **The second candle is a small bullish candle** that opens and closes inside the body of the first candle.

## Relationship - Candlestick

The Bullish Harami is a subtle but important reversal signal.

- **Bearish Harami:** This is the direct bearish counterpart. The [[BearishHarami]] appears at the top of an uptrend and signals a potential bearish reversal.
- **Harami Cross:** A more powerful version of the Bullish Harami is the **Harami Cross**. This occurs when the second candle is a [[Doji]] instead of a small-bodied candle. The Doji signifies even greater indecision and increases the likelihood of a significant reversal.
- **Bullish Engulfing Pattern:** The Harami is often considered the inverse of the [[BullishEngulfingPattern]]. The Engulfing pattern is a much more powerful and explosive reversal signal, while the Harami is a quieter, more tentative signal of a potential change in trend.
- **Three Inside Up:** The Bullish Harami is the first two candles of the **[[ThreeInsideUp]]** pattern. The third candle in this pattern is a bullish candle that closes above the high of the Harami pattern, providing the necessary confirmation for the reversal.
