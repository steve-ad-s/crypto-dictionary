# Bullish Abandoned Baby

![[../images/Abandoned Baby (Bullish & Bearish).png]]

The Bullish Abandoned Baby is a very rare but extremely powerful three-candle bullish reversal pattern. It is considered one of the most reliable reversal signals in all of candlestick charting.

## Logical Behavior

This pattern paints a dramatic picture of a complete and total reversal of market sentiment.

1.  **First Candle (Bearish):** A long black/red candle occurs in a clear downtrend, showing that sellers are still in control.
2.  **Second Candle (The Baby):** A [[Doji]] candle that gaps down, such that its entire range (including its shadows) is below the low of the first candle. This Doji represents a moment of indecision, but the complete gap away from the prior candle shows a final, exhausted burst of selling.
3.  **Third Candle (Bullish):** A long white/green candle that opens with a gap up, above the Doji, and closes well into the body of the first candle.

The "abandoned baby" is the Doji, which is left isolated by the gaps on either side. This isolation signifies a complete abandonment of the previous bearish sentiment and a violent shift to bullish control. The bears could not follow through after gapping the price down, and the bulls took over with equal force.

- **Confirmation:** Due to its rarity and structure, the pattern is its own confirmation. It is a very high-probability reversal signal.
- **Volume:** While not strictly required, higher volume on the third candle can add further confirmation to the strength of the reversal.

## Conditions

1.  **A clear downtrend must be in progress.**
2.  **The first candle is a long bearish candle.**
3.  **The second candle is a Doji.**
4.  **The Doji's shadows gap below the shadows of the first candle.**
5.  **The third candle is a long bullish candle.**
6.  **The third candle gaps above the Doji's shadows.**

## Relationship - Candlestick

The Bullish Abandoned Baby is the most decisive of the "star" family of reversal patterns.

- **Bearish Abandoned Baby:** This is the direct bearish counterpart. The [[Bearish Abandoned Baby]] is an extremely strong bearish reversal signal found at the top of an uptrend.
- **Morning Doji Star:** The Bullish Abandoned Baby is a more powerful and specific version of the [[Morning Doji Star]]. The key difference is that the Abandoned Baby requires the shadows of the Doji to gap away from the shadows of the other two candles, showing a more complete separation and reversal.
- **Island Reversal:** This pattern is the candlestick equivalent of a Western **Island Reversal** chart pattern. The "island" is the Doji, left stranded by the gaps on either side.
