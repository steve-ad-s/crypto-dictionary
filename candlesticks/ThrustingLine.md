# Thrusting Line

![[Thrusting Line (Bearish Continuation).png]]

The Thrusting Line is a **Secondary & Nuanced** two-candle pattern that is typically a bearish continuation pattern, but can sometimes signal a bullish reversal if found at a strong support level.

## Relevance & Type

- **Relevance:** Secondary & Nuanced
- **Type:** Double-Candle Bearish Continuation

## Description

This pattern occurs in a downtrend:

1.  **First Candle:** A long black/red candle.
2.  **Second Candle:** A white/green candle that opens with a gap down and then "thrusts" upwards, closing well into the body of the first candle but *below* its midpoint.

## Interpretation

As a bearish continuation pattern, the Thrusting Line shows a more significant rally attempt by the bulls than the [[On Neck Line]] or [[In Neck Line]]. However, because the rally fails to close above the midpoint of the previous day's bearish candle, it is not considered strong enough to reverse the trend. The bears are still seen as having the upper hand.

However, its character can change with context. If this pattern appears after a long decline and near a major support level, the strong upward thrust can be interpreted as a sign of bullish strength. In this context, it can act more like a weak version of the [[Piercing Pattern]] and may signal a bottom.

- **Confirmation:** If the next candle is bearish, the downtrend continues. If the next candle is strongly bullish, a reversal is more likely.

## Conditions

1.  A clear downtrend must be in progress.
2.  The first candle is a long bearish candle.
3.  The second candle is a bullish candle.
4.  The second candle closes within the real body of the first, but below its midpoint.

## Relationship - Candlestick

- **[[Piercing Pattern]]:** The 50% midpoint of the first candle's body is the critical line in the sand. A Thrusting Line fails to cross it and is therefore considered a bearish continuation. A Piercing Pattern successfully closes above it, making it a bullish reversal. The Thrusting Line is a failed Piercing Pattern.
- **[[On Neck Line]] & [[In Neck Line]]:** These are weaker versions of the same concept. They show even less bullish conviction than the Thrusting Line, making their bearish continuation signal more straightforward.
