# Matching Low

![[Matching Low (Bullish Reversal).jpg]]

The Matching Low is a **Secondary & Nuanced** two-candle bullish reversal pattern that signals a potential bottom and support level.

## Relevance & Type

- **Relevance:** Secondary & Nuanced
- **Type:** Double-Candle Bullish Reversal

## Description

This pattern occurs at the end of a downtrend and consists of two bearish candles:

1.  **First Candle:** A long black/red candle continuing the downtrend.
2.  **Second Candle:** Another black/red candle that opens higher than the first candle's close but then sells off to close at the *exact same low* as the first candle.

## Interpretation

The Matching Low pattern demonstrates the formation of a strong support level. On the second day, despite the bears being in control, they are unable to push the price to a new low below the previous day's close. This successful defense of a price level twice in a row indicates that selling pressure is waning and that buyers are beginning to step in at this price. It's a sign that the downtrend has likely run its course and a reversal is imminent. It is considered a more reliable reversal signal than the [[Homing Pigeon]].

- **Confirmation:** Look for a bullish candle on the third day to confirm the reversal.

## Conditions

1.  A clear downtrend must be in progress.
2.  Both candles in the pattern are bearish (black/red).
3.  The closing prices of both candles are identical or very nearly identical.

## Relationship - Candlestick

- **[[Tweezer Bottoms]]:** This pattern is very similar as both signal support. Tweezer Bottoms are defined by matching lows, whereas the Matching Low pattern is more specific, requiring two bearish candles with identical closing prices, making it a clear sign of failed selling pressure at that exact level.
- **[[Homing Pigeon]]:** The Matching Low is a stronger reversal signal than a Homing Pigeon because it establishes a very clear and twice-tested support line.
