# Three Outside Down

![[../images/Three Outside Up - Down.png]]

The Three Outside Down is a three-candle bearish reversal pattern. It is a stronger confirmation of a market top than the [[Bearish Engulfing Pattern]] on its own.

## Logical Behavior

This pattern shows a decisive shift from bullish control to a confirmed bearish reversal over three trading sessions.

1.  **First Candle (Bullish):** The first candle is a small bullish (white/green) candle that occurs during a clear uptrend.
2.  **Second Candle (Bearish Engulfing):** The second candle is a long bearish (black/red) candle that completely engulfs the body of the first candle. This forms a classic [[Bearish Engulfing Pattern]], which is the first powerful sign of a potential top.
3.  **Third Candle (Bearish Confirmation):** The third candle is another long bearish candle that closes below the low of the second candle. This provides strong confirmation that the sellers are now firmly in command and the reversal is underway.

The pattern tells the story of buyers losing their grip (first candle), being decisively overwhelmed by sellers (second candle), and the sellers then following through on their newfound control (third candle).

- **Confirmation:** The pattern itself provides strong confirmation of the Bearish Engulfing signal. A trader would typically look to enter a short position after the close of the third candle.
- **Volume:** For an ideal pattern, volume should increase on the second and third candles, confirming the strength of the selling pressure.
- **With other indicators:** The signal is most potent when it occurs at a major resistance level or after a strong uptrend where oscillators are showing overbought conditions.

## Conditions

1.  **A clear uptrend must be in progress.**
2.  **The first two candles must form a Bearish Engulfing pattern.**
    - The first candle is a bullish candle.
    - The second candle is a bearish candle that engulfs the first.
3.  **The third candle is a bearish candle that closes lower than the second candle.**

## Relationship - Candlestick

The Three Outside Down pattern is a confirmed Bearish Engulfing pattern and is one of the more reliable bearish reversal signals.

- **Three Outside Up:** This is the direct bullish counterpart. The [[Three_Outside_Up]] is a confirmed Bullish Engulfing pattern that appears at the bottom of a downtrend.
- **Bearish Engulfing Pattern:** The Three Outside Down pattern contains the [[Bearish_Engulfing_Pattern]]. The engulfing pattern is the initial reversal warning, and the third candle provides the confirmation.
- **Three Black Crows:** This pattern is psychologically very similar to the [[Three_Black_Crows]]. Both are strong three-candle bearish reversal patterns. The main difference is that the Three Outside Down begins with an engulfing pattern, showing a more dramatic initial reversal, while the Three Black Crows shows a more methodical decline.
