# Bearish Kicking

![[../images/Kicking (Bullish & Bearish).png]]

The Bearish Kicking pattern is a very rare but extremely powerful two-candle bearish reversal pattern. It signals a sudden and dramatic shift in market sentiment from bullish to bearish.

## Logical Behavior

The pattern is formed by two [[Marubozu]] candles of opposite colors, with a gap separating them.

1.  **First Candle (Bullish Marubozu):** The first candle is a Bullish (white/green) Marubozu, a long candle with no shadows. This shows that buyers were in complete control during the session, opening at the low and closing at the high.
2.  **Second Candle (Bearish Marubozu):** The second candle is a Bearish (black/red) Marubozu. It opens with a significant gap down from the first candle's close, and then continues to fall for the entire session, closing at its low.

This pattern represents a violent reversal of fortune. The absolute control exhibited by the buyers on the first day is completely shattered and reversed by the sellers on the second day. The gap between the two candles signifies how sudden and severe the change in sentiment was. There is no warning or period of indecision; control is simply seized by the bears.

- **Confirmation:** The Bearish Kicking pattern is so powerful that it does not require confirmation. It is considered a very high-probability signal of a major top and a subsequent downtrend.
- **Volume:** High volume on the second candle (the Bearish Marubozu) adds further weight to the powerful reversal signal.

## Conditions

1.  **The first candle is a Bullish Marubozu.**
2.  **The second candle is a Bearish Marubozu.**
3.  **There must be a gap down between the two candles.**

## Relationship - Candlestick

The Bearish Kicking pattern is one of the strongest reversal signals, composed of the most decisive single-candle patterns.

- **Bullish Kicking:** This is the direct bullish counterpart. The [[Bullish_Kicking]] pattern consists of a Bearish Marubozu followed by a gap up to a Bullish Marubozu, signaling a violent bullish reversal.
- **Marubozu:** The pattern's strength comes from its two [[Marubozu]] components. The lack of shadows shows complete, one-sided control on both days, but in opposite directions, highlighting the severity of the reversal.
- **Separating Lines:** A Bearish Separating Lines pattern is similar as it involves a Bullish Marubozu followed by a Bearish Marubozu. However, in Separating Lines, both candles open at the same price level; there is no gap. The gap in the Kicking pattern is what makes it a much more potent reversal signal.
