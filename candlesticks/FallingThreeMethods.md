# Falling Three Methods

![[Falling Three Methods (Bearish Continuation).png]]

This is a **MAJOR** bearish continuation pattern that occurs in a downtrend, indicating a brief pause before the decline continues.

## Relevance & Type

- **Relevance:** Major
- **Type:** Five-Candle Bearish Continuation

## Description

The Falling Three Methods pattern is a five-candle pattern that signifies a temporary interruption of a downtrend, which ultimately fails and leads to lower prices.

1.  **First Candle:** A long black/red candle appears in a clear downtrend, showing strong selling pressure.
2.  **Three Middle Candles:** A series of three small-bodied white/green candles follows. These candles trade against the trend but remain within the range of the first candle's high and low. They represent a weak rally or short-covering, but the buying is not strong enough to overcome the prevailing downtrend.
3.  **Fifth Candle:** A final long black/red candle that opens below the close of the last small candle and closes at a new low, below the close of the first candle.

## Interpretation

The pattern illustrates that despite a three-day rally, the bulls could not seize control. The underlying bearish sentiment remains dominant. The final, strong black candle confirms that the sellers have returned with force, breaking to new lows and signaling that the downtrend is set to continue.

- **Confirmation:** The close of the fifth candle below the low of the first candle is the confirmation.
- **Volume:** Ideally, volume should be light during the three-day rally and should expand on the final bearish candle.

## Conditions

1.  A clear downtrend must be in progress.
2.  The first candle is a long bearish candle.
3.  The next three candles are small-bodied bullish candles that remain within the range of the first candle.
4.  The fifth candle is a long bearish candle that closes at a new low, below the close of the first candle.

## Relationship - Candlestick

- **[[Rising Three Methods]]:** This is the direct bullish counterpart, indicating a pause within a strong uptrend. Both patterns show a consolidation that is ultimately resolved in the direction of the primary trend.
