# Unique Three River Bottom

![[Unique Three River Bottom (Bullish Reversal).jpg]]

The Unique Three River Bottom is a very rare **Secondary & Nuanced** three-candle bullish reversal pattern.

## Relevance & Type

- **Relevance:** Secondary & Nuanced
- **Type:** Triple-Candle Bullish Reversal

## Description

This pattern emerges at the end of a downtrend:

1.  **First Candle:** A long black/red candle.
2.  **Second Candle:** A black/red candle with a small body (like a Harami) that makes a new low. Its lower shadow undercuts the low of the first candle.
3.  **Third Candle:** A small white/green candle with a body that is below the body of the second candle, but it fails to make a new low.

## Interpretation

This pattern tells a complex story of a final bearish push that fails. The first candle confirms the downtrend. The second candle attempts to continue the move down but does so with a small body, showing reduced conviction. The third candle is bullish, but more importantly, it fails to break the low set by the second candle. This failure to continue downwards after two bearish days is a sign that the selling pressure has been fully absorbed and the market is ready to reverse. The "river" is the low set by the second candle, which the market is unable to cross.

## Conditions

1.  A clear downtrend must be in progress.
2.  The first candle is a long bearish candle.
3.  The second candle is a small bearish candle that makes a new low.
4.  The third candle is a small bullish candle that closes below the close of the second candle, but does not make a new low.

## Relationship - Candlestick

- **[[Morning Star]]:** This is a very rare and more complex variation of a bullish reversal pattern like the Morning Star. It tells a more specific story about the bears' final, sputtering attempt to push prices lower, which ultimately fails.
- **[[Bullish Harami]]:** The second candle is similar to a Harami candle, showing a reduction in momentum before the final confirmation of support on the third day.
