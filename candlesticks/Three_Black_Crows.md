# Three Black Crows

![[Figure 3.29 - Three Black Crows.png]]

The Three Black Crows is a powerful three-candle bearish reversal pattern. It is considered a strong and reliable signal of a potential top and the beginning of a new downtrend.

## Logical Behavior

The pattern consists of three consecutive long-bodied bearish (black/red) candles. Each candle opens within the body of the previous candle and closes at a new low, creating a downward staircase effect.

This pattern tells a story of a decisive and sustained takeover by the bears:
- **Day 1:** The first "crow" appears, often after an uptrend, representing the first significant push by sellers.
- **Day 2:** The second crow opens within the prior day's range but then falls to close at a new low, confirming the sellers' strength and overwhelming any residual buying interest.
- **Day 3:** The third crow repeats this action, demonstrating persistent selling pressure and solidifying the control of the bears, confirming the new downtrend.

- **Signal Strength:** This is a very strong indication of a trend reversal. The lack of long lower shadows on the candles suggests that sellers are in control for the entire session, closing near the lows.
- **Volume:** An ideal pattern would show increasing volume with each of the three candles, confirming the growing momentum behind the bearish move.
- **Caution:** After a steep Three Black Crows pattern, the market may be temporarily oversold. A short-term bounce or consolidation is possible before the new downtrend resumes.

## Conditions

1.  **Three consecutive long bearish candles.**
2.  **Each candle should open within the body of the previous candle.**
3.  **Each candle should close progressively lower, creating new lows.**
4.  **The candles should have small or no lower shadows.**

## Relationship - Candlestick

The Three Black Crows pattern is a confirmation pattern that often follows other, earlier signs of a top.

- **Three White Soldiers:** This is the direct bullish counterpart. [[Three_White_Soldiers]] is a powerful bullish reversal pattern.
- **Confirmation for other patterns:** The Three Black Crows can act as a powerful confirmation for preceding, more subtle bearish reversal signals like a [[Shooting_Star]], a [[Hanging_Man]], or a [[Bearish_Engulfing_Pattern]]. The appearance of the crows after one of these patterns greatly strengthens the bearish case.
- **Identical Three Crows:** A variation of this pattern is the **Identical Three Crows**. This is an even more bearish version where each of the three candles opens at or very near the close of the previous candle, showing no bullish pullback whatsoever during the session opens.
