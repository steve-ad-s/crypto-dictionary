# Tweezer Bottoms

![[tweezer Tops and Bottoms.png]]

The Tweezer Bottom is a two-candle (or sometimes multi-candle) bullish reversal pattern that occurs at the bottom of a downtrend. The pattern is formed when two or more candles have matching lows, indicating a strong level of support.

## Logical Behavior

The Tweezer Bottom pattern signifies a standoff at a low point where the bears are unable to push prices any lower.

1.  **First Candle (Bearish):** Typically, the first candle is a strong bearish candle that continues the downtrend, making a new low.
2.  **Second Candle (Bullish):** The second candle attempts to surpass the low of the first candle but fails, hitting the exact same low before reversing. The second candle is often a bullish candle (like a [[Hammer]] or a [[Doji]]), which makes the pattern more significant.

The essence of this pattern is the defense of a specific price level. The bears pushed the price down, but the bulls met them with powerful support at that exact level, causing the price to rally. This failure to make a new low suggests that the bearish momentum has been exhausted and a reversal may be at hand.

- **Confirmation:** The pattern is confirmed when the price breaks above the high of the two Tweezer candles.
- **Flexibility:** The candles forming the Tweezer Bottom do not have to be consecutive, though the signal is stronger if they are. The bodies and shadows of the candles can vary as long as the lows are identical or nearly identical.
- **With other indicators:** The significance of a Tweezer Bottom is greatly increased if it forms at a known support level, a Fibonacci retracement level, or when oscillators are oversold.

## Conditions

1.  **A clear downtrend must be in progress.**
2.  **Two or more candles record identical (or nearly identical) lows.**
3.  The first candle is typically bearish, reinforcing the downtrend.
4.  The second candle shows a rejection of the low.

## Relationship - Candlestick

The Tweezer Bottom is a pattern that demonstrates support and can incorporate other bullish signals.

- **Tweezer Tops:** This is the direct bearish counterpart. [[TweezerTops]] form at the end of an uptrend with two or more candles having matching highs, indicating strong resistance.
- **Incorporating other patterns:** A Tweezer Bottom is more powerful if the candles forming it are themselves bullish patterns. For example, a bearish candle followed by a [[Hammer]] that has the same low is a very strong Tweezer Bottom. Similarly, a Tweezer Bottom where the second candle is a [[DragonflyDoji]] or part of a [[BullishEngulfingPattern]] is also a very reliable signal.
- **Double Bottom:** A Tweezer Bottom can be the very beginning of a larger Western chart pattern like a Double Bottom, where the two troughs of the pattern are at the same price level.
