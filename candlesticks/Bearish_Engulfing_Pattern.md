# Bearish Engulfing Pattern

The Bearish Engulfing pattern is a two-candle bearish reversal pattern that signals a potential top in the market and a shift in momentum from buyers to sellers.

## Logical Behavior

This pattern tells a story of a sudden and powerful reversal of sentiment:

1.  **First Candle (Bullish):** The first candle is a bullish (white/green) candle, which is in line with the prevailing uptrend.
2.  **Second Candle (Bearish):** The second candle is a strong bearish (black/red) candle. It opens higher than the previous day's close (a gap up) but then sellers step in with overwhelming force, pushing the price down to close below the previous day's open. The body of this second candle completely "engulfs" the body of the first candle.

This price action demonstrates that although buyers were in control at the open, sellers took over completely, not just wiping out the day's initial gains but also erasing the gains of the entire previous session. This is a significant sign that the bulls have lost control.

- **Confirmation:** The pattern is confirmed if the next candle also closes lower. A break below the low of the engulfing candle provides strong confirmation of the reversal.
- **Volume:** The signal is more reliable if the volume on the second, bearish candle is higher than the volume on the first. This indicates strong selling pressure.
- **With other indicators:** A Bearish Engulfing pattern is most potent when it occurs after a significant uptrend, at a major resistance level, or when oscillators like the RSI are in an overbought condition.

## Conditions

1.  **A clear uptrend must be in place.**
2.  **The first candle is a bullish candle.**
3.  **The second candle is a bearish candle.**
4.  **The body of the second candle must completely engulf the body of the first candle.** (Engulfing the shadows is not required, but it makes the signal stronger).

## Relationship - Candlestick

The Bearish Engulfing pattern is one of the most classic and reliable bearish reversal signals.

- **Bullish Engulfing Pattern:** This is the direct bullish counterpart. The [[Bullish_Engulfing_Pattern]] appears at the bottom of a downtrend and signals a bullish reversal.
- **Dark Cloud Cover:** The [[Dark_Cloud_Cover]] is a similar but less powerful bearish reversal pattern. In a Dark Cloud Cover, the second bearish candle closes below the midpoint of the first bullish candle, but it does not fully engulf it.
- **Confirmation for other patterns:** A Bearish Engulfing pattern can serve as strong confirmation for a preceding single-candle bearish signal, such as a [[Shooting_Star]] or a [[Hanging_Man]].
- **Follow-through:** A Bearish Engulfing pattern can be the first two candles of a [[Three_Black_Crows]] pattern, which would provide very strong confirmation of a new downtrend.
