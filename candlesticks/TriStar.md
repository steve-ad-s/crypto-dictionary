# Tri-Star

![[Tri-Star (Bullish and Bearish Reversal).jpg]]

The Tri-Star is a rare but **MAJOR** reversal pattern formed by three consecutive [[Doji]] candles, signaling extreme indecision at a market top or bottom.

## Relevance & Type

- **Relevance:** Major
- **Type:** Triple-Candle Reversal

## Description

This pattern is a powerful signal of an impending reversal, though it requires confirmation.

- **Bearish Tri-Star (Top):** This appears at the top of an uptrend. The second Doji gaps above the first and third Doji, creating a peak.
- **Bullish Tri-Star (Bottom):** This appears at the bottom of a downtrend. The second Doji gaps below the first and third Doji, forming a trough.

## Interpretation

The appearance of three consecutive Doji candles after a strong trend represents a profound and extended period of indecision. The market has completely lost its directional bias. The energy of the previous trend has been exhausted, and the balance of power between bulls and bears is now on a knife's edge. This extended stalemate often precedes a significant move in the opposite direction. Due to its rarity, its appearance commands immediate attention.

- **Confirmation:** Confirmation is crucial for this pattern. A subsequent candle moving decisively away from the pattern (down from a top, up from a bottom) is required to confirm the reversal.
- **Rarity:** This is one of the rarest candlestick patterns.

## Conditions

1.  A clear uptrend (for a top) or downtrend (for a bottom) must be in progress.
2.  Three consecutive Doji candles appear.
3.  In a Bearish Tri-Star, the second Doji is typically higher than the other two.
4.  In a Bullish Tri-Star, the second Doji is typically lower than the other two.

## Relationship - Candlestick

- **[[Doji]]:** This pattern is the epitome of indecision, being composed of three Doji candles. It shows a complete exhaustion of the prior trend.
- **[[Morning Doji Star]] & [[Evening Doji Star]]:** The Tri-Star can be seen as an extended and more powerful version of these patterns. Where a single Doji star shows indecision, the Tri-Star shows a prolonged and profound stalemate, often leading to a more significant reversal.
