# Bearish Harami

![[Figure 3.27 - Bearish Harami.png]]

The Bearish Harami is a two-candle bearish reversal pattern that appears at the top of an uptrend. "Harami" is an old Japanese word for "pregnant."

## Relevance & Type

- **Relevance:** Major
- **Type:** Double-Candle Bearish Reversal

## Logical Behavior

The Harami pattern tells a story of a potential trend reversal due to a sudden decrease in momentum.

1.  **First Candle (Bullish):** The first candle is a long bullish (white/green) candle, which shows that the buyers are still in control and the uptrend is intact.
2.  **Second Candle (Bearish):** The second candle is a small bearish (black/red) candle whose body is completely contained within the body of the first candle.

The appearance of the small second candle after the long first candle indicates a sudden loss of momentum. The market is unable to continue the prior day's rally, and the trading range contracts significantly. This suggests that the conviction of the buyers is waning and the market is entering a state of indecision.

- **Confirmation:** The Bearish Harami is not a strong reversal signal on its own and requires bearish confirmation. The signal is confirmed if the next candle is a bearish candle that closes below the low of the first, large bullish candle.
- **Volume:** A decrease in volume on the second candle can sometimes be observed, supporting the idea that the trend is losing its strength.
- **With other indicators:** The pattern is more significant if it appears at a major resistance level or when oscillators like the RSI are showing an overbought condition.

## Conditions

1.  **A clear uptrend must be in progress.**
2.  **The first candle is a long bullish candle.**
3.  **The second candle is a small bearish candle** that opens and closes inside the body of the first candle.

## Relationship - Candlestick

The Bearish Harami is a common but subtle signal of a potential trend change.

- **Bullish Harami:** This is the direct bullish counterpart. The [[BullishHarami]] appears at the bottom of a downtrend and signals a potential bullish reversal.
- **Harami Cross:** The **Harami Cross** is a more potent version of the pattern where the second candle is a [[Doji]]. The Doji represents even greater indecision and increases the probability of a reversal.
- **Bearish Engulfing Pattern:** The Harami can be seen as the inverse of the powerful [[BearishEngulfingPattern]]. The Engulfing pattern signals a violent takeover by sellers, while the Harami signals a more gradual loss of bullish momentum.
- **Three Inside Down:** The Bearish Harami constitutes the first two candles of the [[ThreeInsideDown]] pattern. The third candle in this pattern is a bearish candle that closes below the Harami's low, providing the necessary confirmation for the bearish reversal.
