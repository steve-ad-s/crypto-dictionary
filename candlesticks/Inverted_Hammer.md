# Inverted Hammer

![[../images/Figure 3.16 - Inverted Hammer.png]]

An Inverted Hammer is a single-candle bullish reversal pattern that occurs at the bottom of a downtrend. It looks like an upside-down Hammer.

## Logical Behavior

The pattern shows that buyers tried to push the price up, indicated by the long upper shadow. However, sellers managed to push the price back down to close near the open. While sellers prevented a higher close, the initial buying pressure is a sign of potential bullish strength returning to the market. It suggests that the existing downtrend might be losing momentum.

- **If the price goes up after an Inverted Hammer:** This provides the necessary confirmation of the bullish reversal. A strong bullish candle or a gap up on the next period is a strong signal that the reversal is in play.
- **If the price goes down after an Inverted Hammer:** If the price continues to fall and breaks below the low of the Inverted Hammer, the reversal signal is considered to have failed.
- **Volume:** While not a strict requirement, higher volume on the Inverted Hammer candle can suggest a stronger potential for a reversal.
- **With other indicators:** The signal is more reliable if it forms near a support level or if oscillators like the RSI are in oversold territory.

## Conditions

For a candle to be a valid Inverted Hammer, the following conditions must be met:

1.  **The market must be in a downtrend.** An Inverted Hammer-like candle in an uptrend is a Shooting Star, which is a bearish signal.
2.  **The upper shadow should be at least twice the length of the real body.**
3.  **There should be little or no lower shadow.**
4.  The color of the real body is not critical, but a white/green body is considered more bullish than a black/red body.

## Relationship - Candlestick

The Inverted Hammer's significance comes from its shape and its position after a downtrend.

- **Shooting Star:** The Inverted Hammer is visually identical to the Shooting Star. Their meanings are opposite because of the preceding trend. The Inverted Hammer is a bullish signal in a downtrend, while the Shooting Star is a bearish signal in an uptrend.
- **Hammer:** The Hammer is the "right-side-up" version of the Inverted Hammer. Both are bullish reversal signals that appear in downtrends. The Hammer is generally considered a stronger signal because it shows buyers successfully rejecting lower prices and closing near the high.
- **Confirmation:** The Inverted Hammer requires a bullish confirmation candle on the following day. This could be a long white candle, a gap up, or a pattern like a [[Bullish Engulfing Pattern]]. Without confirmation, it is a weak signal.
