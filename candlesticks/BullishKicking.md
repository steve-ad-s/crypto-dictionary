# Bullish Kicking

![[Kicking (Bullish & Bearish).png]]

The Bullish Kicking pattern is a very rare but extremely powerful two-candle bullish reversal pattern. It signals a sudden and dramatic shift in market sentiment from bearish to bullish.

## Logical Behavior

The pattern is formed by two [[Marubozu]] candles of opposite colors, with a gap between them.

1.  **First Candle (Bearish Marubozu):** The first candle is a Bearish (black/red) Marubozu, a long candle with no shadows. This shows that sellers were in complete control during the session, opening at the high and closing at the low.
2.  **Second Candle (Bullish Marubozu):** The second candle is a Bullish (white/green) Marubozu. It opens with a significant gap up from the first candle's close, and then continues to rally for the entire session, closing at its high.

This pattern represents a violent reversal. The complete control exhibited by the sellers on the first day is instantly and totally negated by the buyers on the second day. The gap between the two candles shows how sudden and significant the change in sentiment was. There was no period of indecision; control was simply seized by the bulls.

- **Confirmation:** Like the Abandoned Baby, the Bullish Kicking pattern is so powerful and rare that it is considered its own confirmation.
- **Volume:** High volume on the second candle (the Bullish Marubozu) adds further conviction to the signal.

## Conditions

1.  **The first candle is a Bearish Marubozu.**
2.  **The second candle is a Bullish Marubozu.**
3.  **There must be a gap up between the two candles.**

## Relationship - Candlestick

The Bullish Kicking pattern is one of the strongest reversal signals in candlestick analysis, built from the most decisive single candles.

- **Bearish Kicking:** This is the direct bearish counterpart. The [[BearishKicking]] pattern consists of a Bullish Marubozu followed by a gap down to a Bearish Marubozu, signaling a violent bearish reversal.
- **Marubozu:** The pattern is composed of two [[Marubozu]] candles. This is what gives it its power. The lack of shadows on both candles shows that the sentiment was completely one-sided on both days, but in opposite directions.
- **Separating Lines:** A Bullish Separating Lines pattern is similar in that it involves a Bearish Marubozu followed by a Bullish Marubozu. However, in Separating Lines, the two candles open at the same level; there is no gap. The Kicking pattern's gap makes it a much stronger reversal signal.
