# Stalled Pattern (Deliberation)

![[ Stalled Pattern (Bearish Reversal).png]]

The Stalled Pattern, also known as Deliberation, is a **Secondary & Nuanced** three-candle bearish reversal pattern that indicates a weakening of an uptrend.

## Relevance & Type

- **Relevance:** Secondary & Nuanced
- **Type:** Triple-Candle Bearish Reversal

## Description

This pattern resembles the [[Three White Soldiers]], but with signs of diminishing momentum:

1.  **First Candle:** A long white/green candle in an uptrend.
2.  **Second Candle:** Another long white/green candle that makes a new high.
3.  **Third Candle:** A small white/green candle (often a [[Spinning Top]]) that opens near the second candle's close but fails to make significant upward progress. It may gap up slightly on the open but the small body shows indecision.

## Interpretation

The Stalled Pattern shows that the bullish momentum is waning. After two strong days, the third day's small candle reveals that the buyers are exhausted and losing conviction. They are no longer able to push the price up with the same force. This "stalling" out at the highs is a warning sign that the uptrend is tired and vulnerable to a reversal. It's a period of deliberation before the bears may take control.

- **Confirmation:** A bearish candle on the fourth day closing below the third candle's low would confirm the reversal.

## Conditions

1.  A clear uptrend must be in progress.
2.  The first two candles are strong bullish candles.
3.  The third candle is a small-bodied bullish candle, indicating a loss of momentum.

## Relationship - Candlestick

- **[[Three White Soldiers]]:** The Stalled Pattern is a warning that a Three White Soldiers formation is failing. Where the Three White Soldiers shows relentless buying, the Stalled Pattern's weak third candle shows buyer exhaustion and signals a potential reversal.
- **[[Evening Star]]:** This pattern can be a precursor to an Evening Star. The small third candle acts as the "star," and if it is followed by a strong bearish candle, the full Evening Star reversal pattern is completed.
