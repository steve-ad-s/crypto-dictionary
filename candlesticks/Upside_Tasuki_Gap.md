# Upside Tasuki Gap

![[../images/Tasuki Gap (Upside & Downside).png]]

The Upside Tasuki Gap is a three-candle bullish continuation pattern. It indicates that the current uptrend is likely to continue after a brief pause for profit-taking.

## Logical Behavior

This pattern shows the strength of an ongoing trend and how minor pullbacks are used as buying opportunities.

1.  **First Candle (Bullish):** A long white/green candle appears in a clear uptrend.
2.  **Second Candle (Bullish Gap):** Another white/green candle that gaps up from the first, showing a continuation of the strong buying pressure.
3.  **Third Candle (Bearish Pause):** A black/red candle that opens inside the body of the second candle and then closes down in the gap between the first and second candles.

The story here is that after a strong gap up, some traders took profits, causing a minor pullback. However, this pullback is not strong enough to close the gap. The fact that the price stays above the top of the first candle is a sign of resilience. It is assumed that the trend will now resume, and the gap will act as a support level.

- **Confirmation:** The continuation is confirmed if the next candle closes above the high of the third (bearish) candle.
- **Volume:** Volume may be light on the third candle, indicating that the selling is not very strong.

## Conditions

1.  **A clear uptrend must be in progress.**
2.  **The first candle is a long bullish candle.**
3.  **The second candle is another bullish candle that gaps up.**
4.  **The third candle is a bearish candle that opens within the second candle's body and closes within the gap, but does not close the gap.**

## Relationship - Candlestick

The Upside Tasuki Gap is one of several patterns that deal with gaps, which are always significant in candlestick analysis.

- **Downside Tasuki Gap:** This is the direct bearish counterpart. The [[Downside_Tasuki_Gap]] is a bearish continuation pattern that appears in a downtrend.
- **Gaps (Windows):** In Japanese candlestick terminology, gaps are called "windows." An open window is said to act as support (in an uptrend) or resistance (in a downtrend). The Upside Tasuki Gap is a classic example of the market testing a window as support and finding it holds.
- **Rising Three Methods:** This is another bullish continuation pattern. The Rising Three Methods is a five-candle pattern that also shows a pause in an uptrend, but it is a longer consolidation than the brief, one-day pullback seen in the Tasuki Gap.
