# Mat Hold

![[Mat Hold (Bullish Continuation).jpg]]

The Mat Hold is a **Secondary & Nuanced** bullish continuation pattern. It is a variation of the [[Rising Three Methods]] pattern and is considered a very strong signal.

## Relevance & Type

- **Relevance:** Secondary & Nuanced
- **Type:** Five-Candle Bullish Continuation

## Description

The pattern consists of five candles:

1.  **First Candle:** A long white/green candle in an established uptrend.
2.  **Second Candle:** A smaller black/red candle that gaps up from the first candle's close.
3.  **Third & Fourth Candles:** Two more small bearish candles that move downward but remain above the low of the first big candle.
4.  **Fifth Candle:** A long white/green candle that moves to a new high, confirming the continuation of the uptrend.

## Interpretation

The Mat Hold pattern shows a brief period of consolidation or profit-taking after a strong upward move. The initial gap up shows enthusiasm, which is then tempered by a few days of selling. However, the selling pressure is weak and never threatens the support established by the first candle. The final bullish candle demonstrates that the buyers have regrouped and are powerfully reasserting control, ready to continue the primary uptrend. It's a stronger signal than the Rising Three Methods because of the initial gap up.

## Conditions

1.  A clear uptrend must be in progress.
2.  The first candle is a long bullish candle.
3.  The second candle gaps up and is bearish.
4.  The following two candles are also bearish but stay above the low of the first candle.
5.  The fifth candle is a strong bullish candle closing at a new high.

## Relationship - Candlestick

- **[[Rising Three Methods]]:** The Mat Hold is a more powerful version of the Rising Three Methods. The key difference is the initial gap up after the first bullish candle, which signals stronger underlying conviction from the bulls compared to the simple consolidation of the Rising Three Methods.
