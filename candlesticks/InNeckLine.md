# In Neck Line

![[In Neck Line (Bearish Continuation).png]]

The In Neck Line is a **Secondary & Nuanced** two-candle bearish continuation pattern. It is a slightly more potent signal than the [[On Neck Line]].

## Relevance & Type

- **Relevance:** Secondary & Nuanced
- **Type:** Double-Candle Bearish Continuation

## Description

The In Neck pattern appears in a downtrend:

1.  **First Candle:** A long black/red candle.
2.  **Second Candle:** A small white/green candle that opens with a gap down but rallies to close slightly *into* the real body of the first candle. The close should be at or very near the *closing price* of the first candle.

## Interpretation

Similar to the On Neck pattern, the In Neck Line indicates that a downtrend is likely to persist. The bulls show a bit more strength here than in the On Neck pattern, as they manage to push the price slightly into the prior day's body. However, their rally still stalls at or just below the previous day's close. This failure to achieve a more meaningful recovery demonstrates that the buying pressure is insufficient to reverse the trend. The bears are still in command, and the downtrend is expected to resume.

- **Confirmation:** The downtrend is confirmed if the next candle is bearish and closes at a new low.

## Conditions

1.  A clear downtrend must be in progress.
2.  The first candle is a long bearish candle.
3.  The second candle is a small bullish candle.
4.  The close of the second candle is slightly above the close of the first candle, but still within the lower part of its real body.

## Relationship - Candlestick

- **[[On Neck Line]] & [[Thrusting Line]]:** The In Neck is the middle child of this bearish continuation family. It shows a stronger bullish attempt than the On Neck (which closes at the low) but is weaker than the Thrusting Line (which closes deeper into the body). All three signify a failed rally.
