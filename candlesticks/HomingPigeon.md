# Homing Pigeon

![[Homing Pigeon (Bullish Reversal).jpg]]

The Homing Pigeon is a **Secondary & Nuanced** two-candle bullish reversal pattern. It is a variation of the [[Bullish Harami]] pattern and suggests a potential weakening of the current downtrend.

## Relevance & Type

- **Relevance:** Secondary & Nuanced
- **Type:** Double-Candle Bullish Reversal

## Description

The pattern consists of two candles appearing in a downtrend:

1.  **First Candle:** A long black/red candle.
2.  **Second Candle:** A smaller black/red candle whose real body is completely contained within the real body of the first candle.

## Interpretation

The Homing Pigeon indicates that the downward momentum is slowing. The first candle confirms the bearish trend. However, the second candle has a much smaller trading range and fails to make a new low, showing that the sellers are losing conviction and are unable to push the price down with the same force. This indecision and reduction in momentum can be an early sign that the downtrend is losing its strength and a reversal may be on the horizon. It is considered a milder reversal signal than a classic Bullish Harami, as both candles are bearish.

- **Confirmation:** A subsequent bullish candle closing above the high of the first candle is needed to confirm the reversal.

## Conditions

1.  A clear downtrend must be in progress.
2.  The first candle is a long bearish candle.
3.  The second candle is also a bearish candle.
4.  The real body of the second candle is completely inside the real body of the first candle.

## Relationship - Candlestick

- **[[Bullish Harami]]:** The Homing Pigeon is a weaker version of a Bullish Harami. In a Harami, the second candle is bullish, showing a clear shift in sentiment. In a Homing Pigeon, both candles are bearish; the signal comes only from the loss of downward momentum, making it a more subtle sign of a potential bottom.
