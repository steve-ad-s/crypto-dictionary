# Three White Soldiers

![[../images/Figure 3.28 - Three White Soldiers.png]]

The Three White Soldiers is a powerful three-candle bullish reversal pattern. It is considered one of the strongest and most reliable signals of a potential bottom and the start of a new uptrend.

## Logical Behavior

The pattern consists of three consecutive long-bodied bullish (white/green) candles. Each candle opens within the body of the previous candle and closes at a new high. This creates a distinct "staircase" effect on the chart.

The story it tells is one of a steady and decisive takeover by the bulls.
- **Day 1:** The first "soldier" emerges, often after a period of downtrend or consolidation, signaling the first strong push by buyers.
- **Day 2:** The second soldier opens within the body of the first, showing some minor profit-taking or hesitation, but then marches forward to close at a new high, confirming the buyers' strength.
- **Day 3:** The third soldier repeats the action, demonstrating sustained buying pressure and solidifying the new uptrend.

- **Signal Strength:** This pattern is a very strong indication of a trend reversal. The lack of long upper shadows on the candles indicates that the bulls are in control throughout the session, closing near the highs.
- **Volume:** Ideally, volume should increase with each of the three candles, confirming the growing momentum behind the bullish move.
- **Caution:** After a strong Three White Soldiers pattern, the market may be temporarily overbought. A short period of consolidation or a minor pullback is possible before the new uptrend continues.

## Conditions

1.  **Three consecutive long bullish candles.**
2.  **Each candle should open within the body of the previous candle.**
3.  **Each candle should close progressively higher, creating new highs.**
4.  **The candles should have small or no upper shadows.**

## Relationship - Candlestick

The Three White Soldiers pattern is a confirmation pattern that often follows other reversal signals.

- **Three Black Crows:** This is the direct bearish counterpart. [[Three_Black_Crows]] is a powerful bearish reversal pattern consisting of three long bearish candles.
- **Confirmation for other patterns:** The Three White Soldiers can act as a powerful confirmation for earlier, more tentative bullish reversal signals like a [[Hammer]], a [[Doji]], or a [[Bullish_Engulfing_Pattern]]. If one of those patterns is followed by the Three White Soldiers, the bullish outlook is significantly strengthened.
- **Advance Block:** A variation of this pattern is the **Advance Block**. It looks similar, but the bodies of the second and third candles are progressively smaller, and they may have longer upper shadows. This indicates that the buying pressure is struggling to continue, and the rally might be losing momentum.
