# Ladder Bottom

![[Ladder Bottom (Bullish Reversal).jpg]]

The Ladder Bottom is a **Secondary & Nuanced** five-candle bullish reversal pattern that appears at the end of a downtrend.

## Relevance & Type

- **Relevance:** Secondary & Nuanced
- **Type:** Five-Candle Bullish Reversal

## Description

The pattern unfolds over five days:

1.  **First, Second & Third Candles:** Three long black/red candles, each with a lower open and lower close than the previous day. This looks like the beginning of [[Three Black Crows]] in a downtrend.
2.  **Fourth Candle:** A black/red candle with a small body and a long upper shadow.
3.  **Fifth Candle:** A large white/green candle that opens with a gap up, above the close of the fourth candle, and continues to rally strongly.

## Interpretation

The Ladder Bottom pattern illustrates a gradual loss of bearish momentum followed by a sudden and sharp reversal. The first three days show a strong, controlled decline. The fourth day, however, shows a struggle; the bears try to push the price down but meet resistance, resulting in a long upper shadow. This is the first sign of weakness. The final day's bullish gap and strong rally confirm that the buyers have seized control decisively from the exhausted sellers. The pattern resembles a "ladder" that the price climbs to reverse its trend.

## Conditions

1.  A clear downtrend must be in progress.
2.  The first three candles are long and bearish, with progressively lower lows.
3.  The fourth candle is bearish with a small body and a long upper shadow.
4.  The fifth candle is a strong bullish candle that gaps up on the open.

## Relationship - Candlestick

- **[[Three Black Crows]]:** The Ladder Bottom begins as if it's forming this powerful bearish pattern, which makes the subsequent reversal even more dramatic. It essentially acts as a trap for sellers who anticipated a continuation of the trend signaled by the first three candles.
- **[[Morning Star]]:** The Ladder Bottom is a more extended, five-day version of a bottom reversal. Where the Morning Star shows a single day of indecision, the Ladder Bottom shows two days (the fourth and fifth candles) of the tide turning.
