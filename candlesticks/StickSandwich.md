# Stick Sandwich

![[Stick Sandwich (Bullish Reversal).png]]

The Stick Sandwich is a **Secondary & Nuanced** three-candle bullish reversal pattern. It is relatively rare but provides a strong indication of a potential bottom.

## Relevance & Type

- **Relevance:** Secondary & Nuanced
- **Type:** Triple-Candle Bullish Reversal

## Description

The pattern is characterized by three candles:

1.  **First Candle:** A long black/red candle in a downtrend.
2.  **Second Candle:** A white/green candle that trades above the close of the first candle.
3.  **Third Candle:** A long black/red candle that has the *same closing price* as the first candle.

The two bearish candles create a "sandwich" around a single bullish candle, with their identical closes forming a strong support level.

## Interpretation

The Stick Sandwich pattern shows a clear rejection of lower prices. After the first bearish day, the bulls attempt a rally. While the bears fight back on the third day and push the price down, they are unable to break below the support established by the close of the first day. This failure to make a new low indicates that the selling momentum has been exhausted, and the bulls are successfully defending the price level, making a reversal to the upside likely.

## Conditions

1.  A clear downtrend must be in progress.
2.  The first and third candles are bearish.
3.  The second candle is bullish and closes above the close of the first candle.
4.  The closing prices of the first and third candles are identical.

## Relationship - Candlestick

- **[[Matching Low]]:** Both patterns indicate the formation of a strong support level. The Stick Sandwich does so with an intervening bullish day, showing a failed rally that still respects the support line established by the two identical closes.
- **[[Tweezer Bottoms]]:** This pattern is similar in that it finds support at a specific price level. However, Tweezer Bottoms are defined by matching lows, while the Stick Sandwich is defined by the matching closes of its two bearish candles.
