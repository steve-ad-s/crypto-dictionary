# Three Outside Up

![[../images/Three Outside Up - Down.png]]

The Three Outside Up is a three-candle bullish reversal pattern. It is an even stronger confirmation of a reversal than the [[Bullish Engulfing Pattern]] alone.

## Logical Behavior

This pattern shows a powerful shift from bearish sentiment to a confirmed bullish reversal over three sessions.

1.  **First Candle (Bearish):** The first candle is a small bearish (black/red) candle that occurs during a downtrend.
2.  **Second Candle (Bullish Engulfing):** The second candle is a long bullish (white/green) candle that completely engulfs the body of the first candle. This forms a classic [[Bullish Engulfing Pattern]], which is the first major sign of the reversal.
3.  **Third Candle (Bullish Confirmation):** The third candle is another long bullish candle that closes above the high of the second candle. This provides a strong confirmation that the buyers are now in control and the reversal has momentum.

The pattern tells the story of sellers losing control (first candle), being decisively overtaken by buyers (second candle), and the buyers then confirming their newfound power (third candle).

- **Confirmation:** The pattern itself is a confirmation of the Bullish Engulfing pattern. Aggressive traders might enter after the second candle, while more conservative traders would wait for the close of the third candle.
- **Volume:** An ideal pattern would show an increase in volume on the second and third candles, validating the strength of the bullish move.
- **With other indicators:** The signal is most reliable when it occurs at a significant support level or after a prolonged downtrend where oscillators are showing oversold conditions.

## Conditions

1.  **A clear downtrend must be in progress.**
2.  **The first two candles must form a Bullish Engulfing pattern.**
    - The first candle is a bearish candle.
    - The second candle is a bullish candle that engulfs the first.
3.  **The third candle is a bullish candle that closes higher than the second candle.**

## Relationship - Candlestick

The Three Outside Up pattern is a confirmed Bullish Engulfing pattern and is one of the more reliable reversal signals.

- **Three Outside Down:** This is the direct bearish counterpart. The [[Three_Outside_Down]] is a confirmed Bearish Engulfing pattern that appears at the top of an uptrend and signals a bearish reversal.
- **Bullish Engulfing Pattern:** The Three Outside Up pattern contains the [[Bullish_Engulfing_Pattern]]. The engulfing pattern is the initial, powerful reversal signal, and the third candle of the "Three Outside Up" provides the confirmation.
- **Three White Soldiers:** This pattern is very similar in nature to the [[Three_White_Soldiers]]. Both are strong three-candle bullish reversal patterns. The main difference is the setup: Three Outside Up starts with an engulfing pattern, while Three White Soldiers is a more steady "stair-step" advance.
