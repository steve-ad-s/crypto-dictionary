# Tweezer Tops

![[tweezer Tops and Bottoms.png]]

The Tweezer Top is a two-candle (or sometimes multi-candle) bearish reversal pattern that occurs at the top of an uptrend. The pattern is formed when two or more candles have matching highs, indicating a strong level of resistance.

## Logical Behavior

The Tweezer Top pattern signifies a struggle at a peak where the bulls are unable to push prices any higher.

1.  **First Candle (Bullish):** Typically, the first candle is a strong bullish candle that continues the uptrend, making a new high.
2.  **Second Candle (Bearish):** The second candle attempts to surpass the high of the first candle but fails, reaching the exact same high before reversing. The second candle can be of any type, but a bearish candle (like a [[HangingMan]] or a [[ShootingStar]]) makes the pattern more potent.

The core of this pattern is the rejection of a specific price level. The bulls pushed the price up, but the bears met them with equal or greater force at that exact level, pushing the price back down. This failure to make a new high suggests that the bullish momentum has stalled and a reversal may be imminent.

- **Confirmation:** The pattern is confirmed when the price breaks below the low of the two Tweezer candles.
- **Flexibility:** The candles that form the Tweezer Top do not have to be consecutive, but the closer they are, the more reliable the signal. The bodies and shadows of the candles can vary greatly, as long as the highs are identical or nearly identical.
- **With other indicators:** The significance of a Tweezer Top is greatly increased if it forms at a known resistance level, a Fibonacci extension level, or when oscillators are overbought.

## Conditions

1.  **A clear uptrend must be in progress.**
2.  **Two or more candles record identical (or nearly identical) highs.**
3.  The first candle is typically bullish, reinforcing the uptrend.
4.  The second candle shows a rejection of the high.

## Relationship - Candlestick

The Tweezer Top is a pattern that demonstrates resistance and can incorporate other bearish signals.

- **Tweezer Bottoms:** This is the direct bullish counterpart. [[TweezerBottoms]] form at the end of a downtrend with two or more candles having matching lows, indicating strong support.
- **Incorporating other patterns:** A Tweezer Top is more powerful if the candles forming it are themselves bearish patterns. For example, a bullish candle followed by a [[HangingMan]] that has the same high is a very strong Tweezer Top. Similarly, a Tweezer Top where the second candle is a [[Shooting_Star]] or part of a [[BearishEngulfingPattern]] is also a very reliable signal.
- **Double Top:** A Tweezer Top can be the very beginning of a larger Western chart pattern like a Double Top, where the two peaks of the pattern are at the same price level.
