# Doji

![[Figure 3.18 - Doji.png]]

A Doji is a single candlestick pattern that reveals indecision in the market. It is one of the most important and common signals in candlestick charting.

## Relevance & Type

- **Relevance:** Major
- **Type:** Single-Candle Indecision / Reversal

## What is a Doji?

A Doji occurs when the opening and closing prices of a security are virtually identical. The lengths of the upper and lower shadows can vary, creating different types of Doji, but the core story is one of equilibrium and indecision.

## Logical Behavior

The core story of a Doji is a tug-of-war between buyers and sellers where neither side could gain control. The session may have seen significant price movement up and down (long shadows), but by the end, the price came back to where it started. This represents a moment of equilibrium and uncertainty.

- **In an uptrend:** A Doji suggests that the buying momentum is slowing down and the trend may be about to reverse. It's a sign that the conviction of the bulls is wavering.
- **In a downtrend:** A Doji indicates that selling pressure is diminishing and the trend might be nearing its end. Sellers are no longer able to push the price down definitively.
- **Confirmation is key:** A Doji on its own is a neutral pattern. The price action on the next candle is crucial for confirmation. A move above the Doji's high can signal a bullish continuation/reversal, while a move below its low can signal a bearish one.
- **Volume:** A Doji with high volume carries more weight, as it implies that a large number of participants were involved in the indecisive session, making the potential turning point more significant.

## Conditions

1.  **Open and Close are (nearly) identical:** The defining characteristic is the lack of a real body.
2.  **The length of the shadows can vary:** Long shadows indicate a lot of volatility and indecision during the session. Short shadows indicate a quiet, listless market.
3.  **Context is crucial:** A Doji is most significant when it appears after a strong trend (either up or down) and at key support or resistance levels. A Doji in a sideways, choppy market has little to no predictive value.

## Relationship - Candlestick

The Doji is a fundamental building block in many candlestick patterns and has several important variations.

- **Variations:**
    - [[DragonflyDoji]]: A bullish reversal Doji with a long lower shadow and no upper shadow.
    - [[GravestoneDoji]]: A bearish reversal Doji with a long upper shadow and no lower shadow.
    - **Long-Legged Doji:** Has long upper and lower shadows, showing extreme indecision.
    - **Four Price Doji:** A rare pattern where the open, high, low, and close are all the same, representing ultimate indecision and low volume.
- **As part of larger patterns:** The Doji is a key component of powerful multi-candle patterns.
    - **[[MorningDojiStar]]:** A bullish reversal pattern where a Doji gaps down between a long black candle and a long white candle.
    - **[[EveningDojiStar]]:** A bearish reversal pattern where a Doji gaps up between a long white candle and a long black candle.
    - **Harami Cross:** A [[BullishHarami]] or [[BearishHarami]] pattern where the second candle is a Doji, making the reversal signal stronger.
