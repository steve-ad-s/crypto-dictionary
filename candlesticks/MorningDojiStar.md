# Morning Doji Star

![[Morning & Evening Doji Star.png]]

The Morning Doji Star is a three-candle bullish reversal pattern that is a more powerful variation of the standard [[Morning Star]]. The presence of a [[Doji]] as the second candle signals greater indecision at the market bottom before the reversal.

## Relevance & Type

- **Relevance:** Major
- **Type:** Triple-Candle Bullish Reversal

## Logical Behavior

The pattern tells a story of complete seller exhaustion and a decisive bullish reversal.

1.  **First Candle (Bearish):** A long black/red candle confirms that the downtrend is still in effect and sellers are in control.
2.  **Second Candle (The Doji Star):** A [[Doji]] candle that gaps down from the body of the first candle. The gap down shows continued selling pressure, but the Doji itself represents a complete halt in momentum and a perfect equilibrium between buyers and sellers. This is a moment of profound indecision after a strong trend, which is a powerful warning sign.
3.  **Third Candle (Bullish):** A long white/green candle that opens higher than the Doji and closes well into the body of the first candle. This confirms that the indecision has been resolved to the upside and that buyers have taken firm control.

- **Confirmation:** The pattern is confirmed when the price moves above the high of the third candle. The strength of the reversal is greater if the third candle is longer and has higher volume.
- **The Gap:** The gaps on either side of the Doji are important. The gap down shows the final burst of selling, and the gap up on the third candle shows the strength of the buyers' return.
- **With other indicators:** The Morning Doji Star is most reliable when it forms at a key support level or when momentum oscillators are showing bullish divergence, providing multiple confirmations of a potential bottom.

## Conditions

1.  **A clear downtrend must be in place.**
2.  **The first candle is a long bearish candle.**
3.  **The second candle is a Doji that gaps below the body of the first candle.**
4.  **The third candle is a long bullish candle** that closes at least halfway into the body of the first candle.

## Relationship - Candlestick

The Morning Doji Star is a very strong reversal pattern due to the presence of the Doji.

- **Evening Doji Star:** The [[EveningDojiStar]] is the direct bearish counterpart to the Morning Doji Star. It appears at the top of an uptrend and signals a bearish reversal with a Doji at the peak.
- **Morning Star:** This pattern is a variation of the [[MorningStar]]. The only difference is that the middle candle is a Doji instead of a Spinning Top. The Doji represents greater indecision, and therefore the Morning Doji Star is considered a more potent reversal signal.
- **Bullish Abandoned Baby:** The [[BullishAbandonedBaby]] is an even rarer and more powerful version of this pattern. In an Abandoned Baby, the Doji's shadows also gap below the shadows of the first and third candles, showing a complete disconnection and abandonment of the previous trend.
