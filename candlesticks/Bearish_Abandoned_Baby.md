# Bearish Abandoned Baby

![[Abandoned Baby (Bullish & Bearish).png]]

The Bearish Abandoned Baby is a very rare but extremely powerful three-candle bearish reversal pattern. It is one of the most reliable and sought-after signals of a major market top.

## Logical Behavior

This pattern paints a dramatic picture of a complete and total reversal of market sentiment at a peak.

1.  **First Candle (Bullish):** A long white/green candle occurs in a clear uptrend, showing that buyers are still firmly in control.
2.  **Second Candle (The Baby):** A [[Doji]] candle that gaps up, such that its entire range (including its shadows) is above the high of the first candle. This Doji represents a moment of indecision at a new high, and the complete gap away from the prior candle shows a final, climactic burst of buying.
3.  **Third Candle (Bearish):** A long black/red candle that opens with a gap down, below the Doji, and closes well into the body of the first candle.

The "abandoned baby" is the Doji, left isolated and stranded by the gaps on either side. This isolation signifies a complete abandonment of the previous bullish sentiment and a violent shift to bearish control. The bulls could not follow through after gapping the price to a new high, and the bears took over with overwhelming force.

- **Confirmation:** Due to its rarity and powerful structure, the pattern is its own confirmation. It is a very high-probability reversal signal.
- **Volume:** While not strictly required, higher volume on the third candle can add further confirmation to the strength of the reversal.

## Conditions

1.  **A clear uptrend must be in progress.**
2.  **The first candle is a long bullish candle.**
3.  **The second candle is a Doji.**
4.  **The Doji's shadows gap above the shadows of the first candle.**
5.  **The third candle is a long bearish candle.**
6.  **The third candle gaps below the Doji's shadows.**

## Relationship - Candlestick

The Bearish Abandoned Baby is the most decisive of the "star" family of bearish reversal patterns.

- **Bullish Abandoned Baby:** This is the direct bullish counterpart. The [[Bullish_Abandoned_Baby]] is an extremely strong bullish reversal signal found at the bottom of a downtrend.
- **Evening Doji Star:** The Bearish Abandoned Baby is a more powerful and specific version of the [[Evening_Doji_Star]]. The key difference is that the Abandoned Baby requires the shadows of the Doji to gap away from the shadows of the other two candles, showing a more complete separation and reversal of sentiment.
- **Island Reversal:** This pattern is the candlestick equivalent of a Western **Island Reversal** chart pattern. The "island" is the Doji, left stranded by the gaps on either side, signifying a peak that is unlikely to be revisited soon.
