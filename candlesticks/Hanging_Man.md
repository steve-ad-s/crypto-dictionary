# Hanging Man

![[../images/Figure 3.17 - Hanging Man.png]]

The Hanging Man is a single-candle bearish reversal pattern that occurs at the top of an uptrend. It is visually identical to the Hammer pattern but has different implications due to its position in the trend.

## Logical Behavior

A Hanging Man pattern signals a potential reversal of an uptrend. The long lower shadow shows that sellers managed to push the price significantly lower during the session, even though buyers brought it back up to close near the open. This intra-session sell-off is a warning sign that the bullish momentum is waning and sellers are starting to test the market's strength.

- **If the price goes down after a Hanging Man:** This confirms the bearish signal. A gap down or a long black/red candle on the next trading day provides strong evidence that a reversal is underway.
- **If the price goes up after a Hanging Man:** If the price continues to rise and makes a new high above the Hanging Man, the bearish signal is invalidated.
- **Volume:** A Hanging Man pattern is considered more reliable if the volume on the Hanging Man day is higher than the surrounding days.
- **With other indicators:** The pattern's bearish signal is stronger if it appears at a known resistance level or if an oscillator, like the RSI, is in an overbought condition.

## Conditions

For a candle to be a valid Hanging Man, the following conditions must be met:

1.  **The market must be in an uptrend.** A Hanging Man-like candle in a downtrend is a Hammer, which is a bullish signal.
2.  **The lower shadow should be at least twice the length of the real body.** The longer the lower shadow, the more significant the potential reversal.
3.  **There should be little or no upper shadow.**
4.  The color of the real body is not a critical factor, but a black/red body is more bearish than a white/green body because it shows the close was below the open.

## Relationship - Candlestick

The Hanging Man's identity is tied to its shape and its appearance after an uptrend.

- **Hammer:** The Hanging Man is the bearish counterpart to the bullish Hammer. They look the same, but the Hammer appears in a downtrend. This highlights the absolute importance of the preceding trend in candlestick analysis.
- **Shooting Star:** The Shooting Star is another single-candle bearish reversal pattern that appears in an uptrend. It has a long upper shadow, signifying a rejection of higher prices, whereas the Hanging Man's long lower shadow signifies a loss of bullish support during the session.
- **Confirmation:** Like most reversal patterns, the Hanging Man requires bearish confirmation. This can come from a following candle, such as a long black [[Marubozu]] or a [[Bearish Engulfing Pattern]], which would solidify the bearish reversal.
