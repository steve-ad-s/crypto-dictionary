# On Neck Line

![[On Neck Line (Bearish Continuation).jpg]]

The On Neck Line is a **Secondary & Nuanced** two-candle bearish continuation pattern. It is similar to, but less bearish than, the [[In Neck Line]] and [[Thrusting Line]] patterns.

## Relevance & Type

- **Relevance:** Secondary & Nuanced
- **Type:** Double-Candle Bearish Continuation

## Description

This pattern occurs during a downtrend:

1.  **First Candle:** A long black/red candle.
2.  **Second Candle:** A small white/green candle that opens with a gap down but then rallies to close at or very near the *low* of the first candle.

The "line" refers to the low of the first candle, which the second candle's close just touches.

## Interpretation

The On Neck pattern suggests that the downtrend is likely to continue. Although the bulls managed to stage a small rally during the second day, they had very little strength. Their advance was stopped right at the low of the previous day, a key resistance level. This feeble rally attempt shows the bulls are weak and the bears remain in control. The failure to push prices higher after the gap down indicates that the path of least resistance is still to the downside.

- **Confirmation:** A bearish candle following the pattern confirms the continuation of the downtrend.

## Conditions

1.  A clear downtrend must be in progress.
2.  The first candle is a long bearish candle.
3.  The second candle is a small bullish candle.
4.  The close of the second candle is at or very close to the low of the first candle.

## Relationship - Candlestick

- **[[In Neck Line]] & [[Thrusting Line]]:** These three patterns form a family of failed bullish rallies in a downtrend. The On Neck is the weakest, stopping at the prior low. The In Neck pushes slightly into the body, and the Thrusting Line pushes further (but still fails). They show progressively stronger, yet still unsuccessful, bullish counter-attacks.
- **[[Piercing Pattern]]:** This is a true bullish reversal pattern and represents what the On Neck fails to be. A Piercing Pattern must close above the 50% midpoint of the first candle, showing a real shift in power. The On Neck's failure to do so confirms the bearish trend.
