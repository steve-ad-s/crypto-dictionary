# Belt Hold

![[Belt Hold (Bullish and Bearish Reversal).jpg]]

The Belt Hold is a **MAJOR** single-candle reversal pattern. Its significance comes from its stark depiction of a failed gap and a strong counter-attack. It can be either bullish or bearish.

## Relevance & Type

- **Relevance:** Major
- **Type:** Single-Candle Reversal

## Description

- **Bullish Belt Hold:** This appears in a downtrend. The market gaps open at a new low, but buyers immediately step in and drive the price upward for the rest of the session, closing near the high. The candle has a long white/green body with a flat bottom (no lower shadow) and a very small or non-existent upper shadow.
- **Bearish Belt Hold:** This appears in an uptrend. The market gaps open at a new high, but sellers immediately take control and push the price downward for the entire session, closing near the low. The candle has a long black/red body with a flat top (no upper shadow) and a very small or non-existent lower shadow.

The Japanese name for this is *yorikiri*, a term from sumo wrestling which means "pushing your opponent out of the ring."

## Interpretation

The pattern represents a decisive victory for the counter-trend forces on that specific day.

- The Bullish Belt Hold shows that the lowest price of the day was the open, and the bulls were in complete control from that point on, rejecting the bearish gap.
- The Bearish Belt Hold shows that the highest price of the day was the open, and the bears dominated thereafter, rejecting the bullish gap.

This sudden and powerful rejection of a new high or low suggests that the prevailing trend has run out of steam and a reversal is at hand.

## Conditions

1.  A clear downtrend (for bullish) or uptrend (for bearish) must be in progress.
2.  The candle opens with a gap in the direction of the prior trend.
3.  The candle is a long candle of the opposite color.
4.  The candle has little to no shadow on the side of the open (i.e., a flat top for bearish, flat bottom for bullish).

## Relationship - Candlestick

- **[[Marubozu]]:** A Belt Hold is a type of Marubozu. A Bullish Belt Hold is an "Opening White Marubozu," and a Bearish Belt Hold is an "Opening Black Marubozu." The gap at the open is what gives the Belt Hold its specific name and reversal power.
- **[[Hammer]] & [[Shooting Star]]:** Like these other single-candle patterns, the Belt Hold provides a quick and decisive signal of a potential reversal based on one day's dramatic price action.
