# Piercing Pattern

![[piercing_pattern.png]]

The Piercing Pattern is a two-candle bullish reversal pattern that occurs at the bottom of a downtrend. It is the bullish counterpart to the [[Dark Cloud Cover]] pattern.

## Relevance & Type

- **Relevance:** Major
- **Type:** Double-Candle Bullish Reversal

## Logical Behavior

The pattern tells a story of a battle between sellers and buyers where the buyers make a significant comeback.

1.  **First Candle (Bearish):** The first candle is a long bearish (black/red) candle, which confirms that the downtrend is still in force.
2.  **Second Candle (Bullish):** The second candle is a long bullish (white/green) candle. It opens with a gap down, below the low of the previous day, which initially suggests continued selling pressure. However, buyers then step in and push the price up, causing the candle to close more than halfway up the body of the first bearish candle.

This action shows that despite a bearish start, the buyers overwhelmed the sellers and managed to reclaim a significant portion of the previous day's losses. This rejection of lower prices is a strong sign of a potential reversal.

- **Confirmation:** A bullish candle on the following day that closes higher than the second candle of the pattern provides strong confirmation.
- **Volume:** Higher volume on the second, bullish candle increases the reliability of the signal, as it indicates strong buying conviction.
- **With other indicators:** The signal is most potent when it forms at a key support level or when an oscillator is in an oversold condition.

## Conditions

1.  **A clear downtrend must be in progress.**
2.  **The first candle is a strong bearish candle.**
3.  **The second candle is a strong bullish candle.**
4.  The second candle must open below the low of the first candle.
5.  The second candle must close above the midpoint of the first candle's body.

## Relationship - Candlestick

The Piercing Pattern is a key bullish reversal signal and is related to several other patterns.

- **Dark Cloud Cover:** This is the direct bearish counterpart to the Piercing Pattern. The [[DarkCloudCover]] appears at the top of an uptrend and signals a potential bearish reversal.
- **Bullish Engulfing Pattern:** The Piercing Pattern is similar to the [[BullishEngulfingPattern]], but it is considered slightly less powerful. In an Engulfing pattern, the second candle completely envelops the first, showing a more decisive reversal. In a Piercing Pattern, the recovery is significant but not total.
- **On Neck Line / In Neck Line:** These are similar two-candle patterns that occur in a downtrend. However, in these patterns, the second bullish candle fails to close above the midpoint of the first, showing a much weaker buying response. They are typically considered bearish continuation patterns, unlike the Piercing Pattern.
