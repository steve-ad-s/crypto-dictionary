# Marubozu

![[Figure 3.30 - Marubozu.png]]

The Marubozu is a single-candle pattern that represents the strongest and most decisive price action. "Marubozu" means "bald" or "shaved head" in Japanese, which refers to the candle's lack of shadows. It is a full-bodied candle with no upper or lower wicks.

## Logical Behavior

A Marubozu candle indicates that one side of the market was in complete control for the entire trading session. The open and close are the session's high and low.

- **White/Green Marubozu (Bullish):** This candle forms when the open is the low of the day, and the close is the high of the day. It signifies extreme bullishness. Buyers were in control from the moment the session opened to the moment it closed. It often becomes a support level for future price action.
    - **In an uptrend:** It acts as a powerful continuation signal.
    - **At a bottom:** It can be the first sign of a powerful bullish reversal.

- **Black/Red Marubozu (Bearish):** This candle forms when the open is the high of the day, and the close is the low of the day. It signifies extreme bearishness. Sellers dominated the session from the open to the close. It often becomes a resistance level.
    - **In a downtrend:** It is a strong continuation signal.
    - **At a top:** It can signal a potent bearish reversal.

## Conditions

1.  **A long real body.**
2.  **No upper shadow and no lower shadow.** (In practice, very tiny shadows may be present, but the purer the Marubozu, the stronger the signal).

There are two main types:
- **Bullish Marubozu:** The close is significantly higher than the open.
- **Bearish Marubozu:** The close is significantly lower than the open.

## Relationship - Candlestick

The Marubozu is a pattern of ultimate conviction and often plays a key role in more complex patterns.

- **Kicking Pattern:** A Marubozu is a key component of the rare and powerful **Kicking** pattern. This pattern consists of a Bearish Marubozu followed by a Bullish Marubozu that gaps up, or vice versa. It's one of the strongest reversal signals.
- **Engulfing Patterns:** A long Marubozu can be the second candle in a [[Bullish_Engulfing_Pattern]] or [[Bearish_Engulfing_Pattern]], making the engulfing signal even more powerful and decisive.
- **Three White Soldiers / Three Black Crows:** The strongest versions of the [[Three_White_Soldiers]] and [[Three_Black_Crows]] patterns are made up of three Marubozu candles, showing complete and sustained control by one side of the market.
- **Belt Hold:** A **Belt Hold** is a type of Marubozu that opens at the high (for a bearish candle) or low (for a bullish candle) and has no shadow on the opening side, but a small shadow on the closing side. It is also a reversal signal, though slightly less powerful than a pure Marubozu.
