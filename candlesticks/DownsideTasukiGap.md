# Downside Tasuki Gap

![[Tasuki Gap (Upside & Downside).png]]

The Downside Tasuki Gap is a three-candle bearish continuation pattern that appears in a downtrend.

## Relevance & Type

- **Relevance:** Secondary & Nuanced
- **Type:** Gap / Triple-Candle Bearish Continuation

## Logical Behavior

This pattern tells a story of a trend that is pausing but still has downward momentum.

1.  **First Candle (Bearish):** A long black/red candle appears in a clear downtrend.
2.  **Second Candle (Bearish Gap):** Another black/red candle that gaps down from the first, showing a continuation of the strong selling pressure.
3.  **Third Candle (Bullish Pause):** A white/green candle that opens inside the body of the second candle and then rallies to close up in the gap between the first and second candles.

The story here is that after a strong gap down, some traders took profits or attempted to pick a bottom, causing a minor rally. However, this rally is not strong enough to close the gap created by the first two candles. The fact that the price stays below the bottom of the first candle is a sign of persistent weakness. It is assumed that the rally will fail, the trend will resume its downward course, and the gap will now act as a resistance level.

- **Confirmation:** The continuation is confirmed if the next candle closes below the low of the third (bullish) candle.
- **Volume:** Volume may be light on the third candle, indicating that the buying is not very enthusiastic.

## Conditions

1.  **A clear downtrend must be in progress.**
2.  **The first candle is a long bearish candle.**
3.  **The second candle is another bearish candle that gaps down.**
4.  **The third candle is a bullish candle that opens within the second candle's body and closes within the gap, but does not close the gap.**

## Relationship - Candlestick

The Downside Tasuki Gap is a classic continuation pattern involving a "window" or gap.

- **Upside Tasuki Gap:** This is the direct bullish counterpart. The [[UpsideTasukiGap]] is a bullish continuation pattern that appears in an uptrend.
- **Falling Three Methods:** This is another bearish continuation pattern. The Falling Three Methods is a five-candle pattern that also shows a pause in a downtrend, but it represents a longer and more complex consolidation than the brief, one-day rally seen in the Tasuki Gap.
