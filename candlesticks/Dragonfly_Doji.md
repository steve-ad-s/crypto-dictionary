# Dragonfly Doji

![[../images/Figure 3.20 - Dragonfly Doji.png]]

The Dragonfly Doji is a significant single-candle bullish reversal pattern. It is a type of [[Doji]] where the open, high, and close prices are the same (or very close), and there is a long lower shadow. It has little to no upper shadow.

## Logical Behavior

The story of a Dragonfly Doji is one of a dramatic victory for the bulls. The long lower shadow shows that sellers pushed the price down significantly after the open. However, the buying pressure was so strong that by the end of the session, the price had rallied all the way back up to close at the opening price. This represents a powerful rejection of lower prices and indicates that the control has shifted firmly from sellers to buyers.

- **At the bottom of a downtrend:** A Dragonfly Doji is a strong signal of a potential bottom and an impending bullish reversal. It suggests capitulation selling was absorbed by aggressive buying.
- **Confirmation is recommended:** While a strong signal, it is wise to wait for confirmation. A subsequent candle that closes above the Dragonfly's high provides strong validation of the reversal.
- **Volume:** High volume on the Dragonfly Doji candle adds to its significance, as it shows that the battle between bulls and bears was intense and the bulls' victory was decisive.
- **With other indicators:** The signal is most potent when it occurs at a major support level, a trendline, or when an oscillator like the RSI is indicating an oversold condition.

## Conditions

1.  **Open, High, and Close are the same:** The candle should have no real body, with the session's open, high, and close prices being identical.
2.  **Long lower shadow:** There must be a long lower shadow, indicating the intra-session sell-off.
3.  **No upper shadow:** There should be no, or a very negligible, upper shadow.
4.  **Preceding downtrend:** For the Dragonfly Doji to be a valid reversal signal, it must appear after a period of selling.

## Relationship - Candlestick

The Dragonfly Doji is a specialized and powerful version of a standard Doji.

- **Doji:** It is a specific type of [[Doji]], carrying a more explicitly bullish bias than a standard Doji, which is more neutral.
- **Gravestone Doji:** This is the direct opposite of a Dragonfly Doji. The [[Gravestone_Doji]] has a long upper shadow and is a bearish reversal signal. The two are mirror images in both appearance and meaning.
- **Hammer:** A [[Hammer]] is very similar in interpretation to a Dragonfly Doji. Both are bullish reversal patterns with long lower shadows. The main difference is that a Hammer has a small real body, while a Dragonfly Doji has none. The Dragonfly is generally considered a stronger, more decisive signal.
- **Confirmation Patterns:** After a Dragonfly Doji, a strong bullish pattern like [[Three_White_Soldiers]] or a [[Bullish_Engulfing_Pattern]] would provide powerful confirmation of the new uptrend.
