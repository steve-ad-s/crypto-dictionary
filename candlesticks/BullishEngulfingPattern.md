# Bullish Engulfing Pattern

![[Figure 3.24 - Bullish Engulfing Pattern.png]]

The Bullish Engulfing Pattern is a powerful two-candle bullish reversal pattern that occurs at the bottom of a downtrend.

## Relevance & Type

- **Relevance:** Major
- **Type:** Double-Candle Bullish Reversal

## Logical Behavior

The pattern's story is one of a dramatic and decisive reversal within a single period:

1.  **First Candle (Bearish):** The first candle is a bearish (black/red) candle that is consistent with the current downtrend.
2.  **Second Candle (Bullish):** The second candle is a strong bullish (white/green) candle that opens lower than the previous day's close but then rallies to close higher than the previous day's open. Its body completely "engulfs" the body of the first candle.

This price action shows that while sellers were in control at the open, creating a gap down, the buyers stepped in with overwhelming force, not only erasing the day's losses but also surpassing the entire price range of the previous day. This is a powerful sign of a sentiment shift.

- **Confirmation:** The pattern is confirmed if the price continues to rise on the next candle. A close above the high of the engulfing candle is a strong confirmation.
- **Volume:** A Bullish Engulfing pattern is more reliable if the volume on the second, bullish candle is significantly higher than the first. This shows strong conviction behind the buying pressure.
- **With other indicators:** The signal is stronger when it appears after a prolonged downtrend, at a major support level, or when oscillators are in oversold territory.

## Conditions

1.  **A clear downtrend must be in progress.**
2.  **The first candle is a bearish candle.**
3.  **The second candle is a bullish candle.**
4.  **The body of the second candle must completely engulf the body of the first candle.** (The shadows do not need to be engulfed, but it's a stronger signal if they are).

## Relationship - Candlestick

The Bullish Engulfing pattern is one of the most widely recognized and powerful reversal signals.

- **Bearish Engulfing Pattern:** This is the direct bearish counterpart. The [[BearishEngulfingPattern]] occurs at the top of an uptrend and signals a bearish reversal.
- **Piercing Pattern:** The Piercing Pattern is a similar, but slightly less powerful, bullish reversal pattern. In a Piercing Pattern, the second bullish candle closes more than halfway up the body of the first bearish candle, but does not completely engulf it.
- **Confirmation for other patterns:** A Bullish Engulfing pattern can act as a powerful confirmation for a preceding single-candle reversal signal, such as a [[Hammer]] or a [[DragonflyDoji]].
- **Follow-through:** A Bullish Engulfing pattern is often the first two candles of a [[ThreeWhiteSoldiers]] pattern, which would provide extremely strong confirmation of the new uptrend.
