# Hammer

![[Figure 3.13 - Hammer.png]]

The Hammer is a single candle bullish reversal pattern that appears at the bottom of a downtrend.

## Relevance & Type

- **Relevance:** Major
- **Type:** Single-Candle Bullish Reversal

## Logical Behavior

The long lower shadow of the hammer implies that the market traded significantly lower than its opening price, but then rallied to close near the open. This shows that sellers were initially in control, but buyers came in with strong force to push the price back up.

- **If the price goes up after a Hammer:** This confirms the bullish reversal signal. The stronger the confirmation (e.g., a long white candle, a gap up), the more reliable the signal.
- **If the price goes down after a Hammer:** If the low of the Hammer is broken, it invalidates the reversal signal.
- **Volume:** A Hammer with high volume is more potent than one with low volume, as it indicates a stronger capitulation by sellers and a more decisive entry of buyers.
- **With other indicators:** When a Hammer appears near a major support level, a trendline, or in an oversold condition (e.g., RSI below 30), its significance is greatly increased.

## Conditions

For a candle to be a valid Hammer, the following conditions should be met:

1.  **The market must be in a downtrend.** A Hammer-like candle in an uptrend is a Hanging Man, which has bearish implications.
2.  **The lower shadow should be at least twice the length of the real body.** The longer the lower shadow, the more bullish the signal.
3.  **There should be little or no upper shadow.**
4.  The color of the body is not critical, but a white/green body is more bullish than a black/red body as it shows the close was higher than the open.

## Relationship - Candlestick

The Hammer is part of the family of single-candle patterns with long shadows. Its relationships are defined by its appearance and its location in a trend.

- **Hanging Man:** A Hammer in an uptrend becomes a [[HangingMan]]. They are visually identical but have opposite implications due to the preceding trend.
- **Inverted Hammer & Shooting Star:** These are the "upside-down" versions of the Hammer. An [[InvertedHammer]] is a potential bullish reversal signal (like the Hammer), while a [[ShootingStar]] is a bearish reversal signal.
- **Confirmation:** A Hammer is often followed by a confirmation candle on the next period. A strong bullish candle, like a [[BullishEngulfingPattern]] or a [[Marubozu]], can confirm the reversal. The absence of a strong follow-up might indicate a weak reversal.
