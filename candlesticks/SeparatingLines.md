![[Separating Lines (Bullish and Bearish Continuation).jpg]]

The Separating Lines pattern is a **Secondary & Nuanced** two-candle continuation pattern. It can be either bullish or bearish.

## Relevance & Type

- **Relevance:** Secondary & Nuanced
- **Type:** Double-Candle Continuation

## Description

- **Bullish Separating Lines:** In an uptrend, a long black/red candle appears. The next day, the price opens with a gap up to the *same open* as the previous day and continues to rally, forming a long white/green candle.
- **Bearish Separating Lines:** In a downtrend, a long white/green candle appears. The next day, the price opens with a gap down to the *same open* as the previous day and continues to sell off, forming a long black/red candle.

## Interpretation

This pattern shows a strong resumption of the primary trend after a single day of counter-trend movement. The key is the common opening price.

- In the bullish version, the single bearish day is completely negated when the price gaps up to its open and rallies from there. It shows the counter-move was insignificant and the bulls are back in full control.
- In the bearish version, a one-day rally is erased when the price gaps down to its open and continues to fall, showing the bears have reasserted their dominance.

It's a powerful sign that the pause was temporary and the original trend is continuing with renewed vigor.

## Conditions

1.  A clear uptrend (for bullish) or downtrend (for bearish) must exist.
2.  The first candle is a long candle against the primary trend.
3.  The second candle is a long candle in the direction of the primary trend.
4.  Both candles have the same opening price.

## Relationship - Candlestick

- **[[Meeting Lines]]:** These patterns are opposites. Separating Lines are continuation patterns with matching *opens*, showing the prior day's counter-move was a fluke. Meeting Lines are reversal patterns with matching *closes*, showing the trend has stalled at a support/resistance level. The open versus the close is the critical difference.
