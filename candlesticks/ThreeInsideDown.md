# Three Inside Down

![[Three inside Up - Down.png]]

The Three Inside Down is a three-candle bearish reversal pattern. It is a stronger confirmation of a market top than the [[BearishHarami]] pattern is on its own.

## Logical Behavior

This pattern illustrates a clear shift in market power from buyers to sellers over three trading sessions.

1.  **First Candle (Bullish):** The first candle is a long bullish (white/green) candle that is part of a clear uptrend, showing that buyers are still in command.
2.  **Second Candle (Indecision):** The second candle is a small bearish (black/red) candle whose body is completely contained within the body of the first candle. This forms a [[BearishHarami]] pattern, which is the first sign that the bullish momentum is waning.
3.  **Third Candle (Bearish Confirmation):** The third candle is a long bearish candle that closes below the low of the first candle. This candle confirms the reversal, demonstrating that sellers have now decisively taken control.

The story is one of a trend exhausting itself, pausing for a moment of indecision (the Harami), and then reversing as sellers follow through with enough force to negate the gains of the initial bullish day.

- **Confirmation:** The pattern itself is a confirmation signal. A trader might enter a short position after the close of the third candle.
- **Volume:** An ideal pattern would show the highest volume on the third candle, confirming the strength and conviction of the sellers.
- **With other indicators:** This pattern is most significant when it forms at a major resistance level or when oscillators are showing overbought conditions, as this provides multiple reasons for a potential reversal.

## Conditions

1.  **A clear uptrend must be in progress.**
2.  **The first two candles must form a Bearish Harami pattern.**
    - The first candle is a long bullish candle.
    - The second candle is a small bearish candle contained within the first candle's body.
3.  **The third candle is a long bearish candle that closes below the low of the first candle.**

## Relationship - Candlestick

The Three Inside Down pattern is a confirmed Bearish Harami.

- **Three Inside Up:** This is the direct bullish counterpart. The [[ThreeInsideUp]] is a confirmed Bullish Harami that appears at the bottom of a downtrend and signals a bullish reversal.
- **Bearish Harami:** The Three Inside Down pattern's first two candles form the [[Bearish_Harami]]. The Harami is a warning of a potential top; the Three Inside Down is the confirmation.
- **Evening Star:** This pattern is psychologically similar to the [[EveningStar]]. Both are three-candle bearish reversal patterns that show a transition from bullishness to indecision to bearishness. The Evening Star is often considered slightly stronger because its middle candle gaps up.
