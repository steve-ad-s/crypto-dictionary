# Three Inside Up

![[../images/Three inside Up - Down.png]]

The Three Inside Up is a three-candle bullish reversal pattern. It is a more reliable confirmation of a reversal than the [[Bullish Harami]] pattern alone.

## Logical Behavior

This pattern shows a clear progression from a downtrend to indecision, and finally to a bullish reversal.

1.  **First Candle (Bearish):** The first candle is a long bearish (black/red) candle that continues the existing downtrend.
2.  **Second Candle (Indecision):** The second candle is a small bullish (white/green) candle whose body is completely contained within the body of the first candle. This is a [[Bullish Harami]] pattern, which signals that the selling momentum is fading.
3.  **Third Candle (Bullish Confirmation):** The third candle is a long bullish candle that closes above the high of the first candle. This candle confirms the reversal, showing that buyers have decisively taken control from sellers.

The pattern signifies that after a period of selling, the market paused (the Harami), and then the bulls followed through with enough strength to erase the losses of the initial bearish candle.

- **Confirmation:** The pattern itself is a confirmation of the Bullish Harami. A trader might enter a long position after the close of the third candle.
- **Volume:** Ideally, the volume should be highest on the third candle, confirming the strength and conviction of the buyers.
- **With other indicators:** This pattern is most significant when it forms at a major support level or when oscillators are in oversold territory, providing multiple signals of a potential bottom.

## Conditions

1.  **A clear downtrend must be in progress.**
2.  **The first two candles must form a Bullish Harami pattern.**
    - The first candle is a long bearish candle.
    - The second candle is a small bullish candle contained within the first candle's body.
3.  **The third candle is a long bullish candle that closes above the high of the first candle.**

## Relationship - Candlestick

The Three Inside Up pattern is fundamentally a confirmed Bullish Harami.

- **Three Inside Down:** This is the direct bearish counterpart. The [[Three_Inside_Down]] is a confirmed Bearish Harami that appears at the top of an uptrend and signals a bearish reversal.
- **Bullish Harami:** The Three Inside Up pattern contains the [[Bullish_Harami]]. The Harami is a sign of potential reversal, while the Three Inside Up is the confirmation of that reversal.
- **Morning Star:** This pattern is similar in psychology to the [[Morning_Star]]. Both are three-candle bullish reversal patterns that show a transition from bearishness to indecision to bullishness. The Morning Star is often considered slightly stronger due to the gap down of its middle candle.
