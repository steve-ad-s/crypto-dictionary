# Evening Doji Star

![[../images/Morning & Evening Doji Star.png]]

The Evening Doji Star is a three-candle bearish reversal pattern. It is a more powerful and decisive version of the standard [[Evening Star]] pattern and is considered a strong signal of a potential market top.

## Logical Behavior

The pattern tells a clear story of a market peak, a moment of perfect indecision, and a subsequent bearish reversal.

1.  **First Candle (Bullish):** A long white/green candle confirms that the uptrend is still strong and buyers are in control.
2.  **Second Candle (The Doji Star):** A [[Doji]] candle that gaps up from the body of the first candle. The gap up represents the final surge of bullish enthusiasm. However, the Doji itself, with its open and close at the same level, signifies a complete stall in momentum and a perfect stalemate between buyers and sellers. This level of indecision after a strong rally is a major red flag.
3.  **Third Candle (Bearish):** A long black/red candle that opens lower than the Doji and closes well into the body of the first candle. This confirms that the indecision of the Doji has been resolved to the downside and that sellers have taken decisive control.

- **Confirmation:** The pattern is confirmed when the price moves below the low of the third candle. The strength of the reversal is greater if the third candle is longer and has higher volume.
- **The Gap:** The gaps on either side of the Doji are crucial. The gap up shows the climax of the buying pressure, and the gap down on the third candle shows the strength of the sellers' return.
- **With other indicators:** The Evening Doji Star is most potent when it forms at a key resistance level or when momentum oscillators like the RSI are showing bearish divergence.

## Conditions

1.  **A clear uptrend must be in place.**
2.  **The first candle is a long bullish candle.**
3.  **The second candle is a Doji that gaps above the body of the first candle.**
4.  **The third candle is a long bearish candle** that closes at least halfway into the body of the first candle.

## Relationship - Candlestick

The Evening Doji Star is a very strong reversal pattern due to the extreme indecision represented by the Doji at the peak.

- **Morning Doji Star:** The [[Morning Doji Star]] is the direct bullish counterpart. It appears at the bottom of a downtrend and signals a bullish reversal.
- **Evening Star:** This pattern is a more potent variation of the standard [[Evening Star]]. The key difference is the middle candle being a Doji rather than a Spinning Top, which signifies greater indecision and makes the subsequent reversal more significant.
- **Bearish Abandoned Baby:** The [[Bearish Abandoned Baby]] is an even rarer and stronger version of this pattern. In an Abandoned Baby, the Doji's shadows also gap above the shadows of the first and third candles, indicating a complete abandonment of the bullish sentiment.
