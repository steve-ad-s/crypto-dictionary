# Concealing Baby Swallow

![[Concealing Baby Swallow (Bullish Reversal).jpg]]

The Concealing Baby Swallow is an extremely rare **Secondary & Nuanced** four-candle bullish reversal pattern. Its complexity makes it very uncommon, but it is considered a potent signal.

## Relevance & Type

- **Relevance:** Secondary & Nuanced
- **Type:** Four-Candle Bullish Reversal

## Description

This pattern occurs in a downtrend and consists of four black/red candles:

1.  **First & Second Candles:** Two consecutive long bearish candles, similar to a [[Marubozu]].
2.  **Third Candle:** A bearish candle that gaps down on the open but then trades up into the body of the second candle. It has a long upper shadow.
3.  **Fourth Candle:** A small bearish candle that completely engulfs the third candle (including its shadow). The open and close are inside the body of the third candle.

## Interpretation

This pattern shows a final, exhaustive push by the bears that ultimately signals their capitulation. The first two days are strongly bearish. The third day gaps down but then reverses, showing the first hint of buying pressure, even though it closes lower. The fourth day's inability to make a new low, despite being bearish, is the final sign that the sellers are spent. The downward momentum has been "swallowed up" and a reversal is now highly probable.

## Conditions

1.  A clear downtrend must be in progress.
2.  The first four candles are all bearish.
3.  The first two are long bearish candles.
4.  The third candle gaps down but has a long upper shadow.
5.  The fourth candle's body engulfs the third candle completely.

## Relationship - Candlestick

- **Bearish Capitulation:** This is not a specific pattern relationship, but a conceptual one. The complex and exhaustive selling over the four days represents a classic selling climax or capitulation, where the last of the sellers exit the market, leaving a vacuum for the bulls to fill. Its rarity is what gives it its power.
