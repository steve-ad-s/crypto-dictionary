# Meeting Lines

![[Meeting Lines (Bullish and Bearish Reversal).jpg]]

The Meeting Lines pattern is a **MAJOR** two-candle reversal pattern that can be either bullish or bearish. It is similar to the [[Piercing Pattern]] and [[Dark Cloud Cover]] but differs in the closing price of the second candle.

## Relevance & Type

- **Relevance:** Major
- **Type:** Double-Candle Reversal

## Description

- **Bullish Meeting Lines:** Occurs in a downtrend. The first candle is a long black/red one. The second candle is a long white/green one that opens with a gap down but then rallies to close at the *exact same price* as the close of the first candle.
- **Bearish Meeting Lines:** Occurs in an uptrend. The first candle is a long white/green one. The second candle is a long black/red one that opens with a gap up but then sells off to close at the *exact same price* as the close of the first candle.

## Interpretation

The pattern shows a powerful but ultimately failed attempt to continue the trend.

- In the bullish version, the bears make a new low on the open, but the bulls fight back with enough force to bring the price all the way back to the prior day's close, rejecting the new lows completely.
- In the bearish version, the bulls make a new high on the open, but the bears step in with overwhelming force, driving the price all the way back down to the prior day's close.

This failure to hold the new highs/lows and the strong closing counter-move indicates that the momentum of the prior trend has stalled and a reversal is likely.

## Conditions

1.  A clear downtrend (for bullish) or uptrend (for bearish) must exist.
2.  The first candle is a long candle following the trend's direction.
3.  The second candle is a long candle of the opposite color.
4.  The closing prices of the two candles are identical or very nearly identical.

## Relationship - Candlestick

- **[[Piercing Pattern]] & [[Dark Cloud Cover]]:** The Meeting Lines pattern is a close cousin to these two patterns. The key difference is the depth of the counter-move. While a Piercing Pattern must close more than halfway into the prior candle's body, the Bullish Meeting Lines only needs to return to the prior close. This makes it a signal of a stall right at a key support/resistance level.
