# Morning Star

![[../images/Figure 3.22 - Morning Star.png]]

The Morning Star is a three-candle bullish reversal pattern that appears at the bottom of a downtrend. It is a powerful signal indicating that a significant shift in momentum from sellers to buyers has occurred.

## Logical Behavior

The pattern tells a clear three-act story of a market bottoming out:

1.  **First Candle (Bearish):** A long black/red candle confirms that the downtrend is still in effect and sellers are firmly in control.
2.  **Second Candle (Indecision):** This is a small-bodied candle (a [[Spinning Top]] or a [[Doji]]) that gaps down from the first candle. This gap down initially seems bearish, but the small body shows that the sellers could not push the price much lower. This is a moment of indecision and the first sign that the selling pressure is exhausting.
3.  **Third Candle (Bullish):** A long white/green candle that closes well into the body of the first candle. This candle confirms that the buyers have taken control and are aggressively reversing the prior downtrend.

- **Confirmation:** The pattern is confirmed when the price moves above the high of the third candle. The strength of the reversal is greater if the third candle is longer and closes higher up the body of the first candle.
- **Volume:** Ideally, volume should be heavy on the third candle, showing strong buying conviction.
- **With other indicators:** The Morning Star is most reliable when it forms at a key support level or when momentum oscillators like the RSI are showing bullish divergence.

## Conditions

1.  **A clear downtrend must be in place.**
2.  **First candle is a long bearish candle.**
3.  **Second candle is a small-bodied candle** (Doji, Spinning Top) that ideally gaps down.
4.  **Third candle is a long bullish candle** that closes at least halfway into the body of the first candle.

## Relationship - Candlestick

The Morning Star is a cornerstone of multi-candle reversal patterns.

- **Evening Star:** The [[Evening Star]] is the direct bearish counterpart to the Morning Star. It appears at the top of an uptrend and signals a bearish reversal. It is a mirror image of the Morning Star pattern.
- **Doji / Spinning Top:** The second candle of the pattern is a candle of indecision. If this middle candle is a [[Doji]], the pattern is called a **Morning Doji Star**, which is considered an even stronger and more decisive reversal signal.
- **Abandoned Baby:** A rare and even more powerful version of the Morning Star is the Bullish Abandoned Baby. This occurs when the second candle (a Doji) gaps down completely, with its shadows not overlapping the shadows of the first and third candles.
- **Confirmation Patterns:** A Morning Star can be the start of a new uptrend. It is often followed by other bullish patterns, such as [[Three White Soldiers]], which would confirm the new trend's strength.
