# Harami Cross

![[Harami Cross (Bullish and Bearish Reversal).jpg]]

The Harami Cross is a **MAJOR** reversal pattern, made more significant than the standard Harami by the presence of a [[Doji]] as the second candle. It can be either bullish or bearish.

## Relevance & Type

- **Relevance:** Major
- **Type:** Double-Candle Reversal

## Description

The Harami Cross indicates a significant moment of indecision that can signal the end of the prior trend.

- **Bearish Harami Cross:** In an uptrend, a long white/green candle is followed by a Doji. The Doji is completely contained within the real body of the first candle.
- **Bullish Harami Cross:** In a downtrend, a long black/red candle is followed by a Doji that is contained within the real body of the first candle.

## Interpretation

The first large candle confirms the strength of the current trend. However, the subsequent Doji shows a sudden and complete evaporation of that directional momentum. The market is now at a standstill, a state of perfect equilibrium between buyers and sellers. This abrupt halt after a strong trend often precedes a reversal as the conviction of the dominant party has been shattered.

- **Confirmation:** A subsequent candle that closes in the direction of the expected reversal serves as confirmation. For a bearish cross, a red candle closing lower is needed. For a bullish cross, a green candle closing higher is needed.
- **Significance:** The Doji makes this pattern more potent than the standard [[Bullish Harami]] or [[Bearish Harami]] which use a spinning top.

## Conditions

1.  A clear uptrend (for bearish reversal) or downtrend (for bullish reversal) must be in progress.
2.  The first candle is a long candle that confirms the trend.
3.  The second candle is a Doji.
4.  The Doji's entire range (body and shadows) is contained within the real body of the first candle.

## Relationship - Candlestick

- **[[Bullish Harami]] & [[Bearish Harami]]:** The Harami Cross is a more powerful and decisive version of the standard Harami pattern. The presence of a [[Doji]] instead of a spinning top signals more profound indecision and a greater likelihood of a reversal.
- **[[Doji]]:** The Doji is the critical component of this pattern, representing the point of peak indecision where the forces of supply and demand are in perfect balance.
