# Shooting Star

![[Figure 3.15 - Shooting Star.png]]

A Shooting Star is a bearish reversal pattern that appears at the top of an uptrend. It has a small real body, a long upper shadow, and little to no lower shadow.

## Logical Behavior

The long upper shadow indicates that the price opened and rallied significantly higher, but then sellers took control and pushed the price back down to close near the open. This represents a rejection of higher prices and suggests that the bulls are losing momentum.

- **If the price goes down after a Shooting Star:** This confirms the bearish reversal signal. A gap down or a long black/red candle on the next period provides strong confirmation.
- **If the price goes up after a Shooting Star:** If the high of the Shooting Star is surpassed, the bearish signal is invalidated.
- **Volume:** A high volume on the Shooting Star candle increases the significance of the potential reversal, as it shows a greater struggle between buyers and sellers where sellers ultimately won.
- **With other indicators:** A Shooting Star is more reliable when it forms at a resistance level, a trendline, or when an oscillator like the RSI is in overbought territory (above 70).

## Conditions

For a candle to be a valid Shooting Star, the following conditions should be met:

1.  **The market must be in an uptrend.** A Shooting Star-like candle in a downtrend is an Inverted Hammer, which has bullish implications.
2.  **The upper shadow should be at least twice the length of the real body.** The longer the upper shadow, the more bearish the signal.
3.  **There should be little or no lower shadow.**
4.  The color of the real body is not as important, but a black/red body is considered slightly more bearish as it means the close was below the open.

## Relationship - Candlestick

The Shooting Star is a key single-candle reversal pattern. Its relationships are defined by its appearance and the context of the preceding trend.

- **Inverted Hammer:** Visually, the Shooting Star and the [[Inverted Hammer]] are identical. The difference is the preceding trend. A Shooting Star occurs after an uptrend (bearish), while an [[Inverted Hammer]] occurs after a downtrend (bullish).
- **Hanging Man & Hammer:** These are the "upside-down" versions of the Shooting Star. The [[Hammer]] is a bullish reversal pattern, and the [[Hanging Man]] is a bearish reversal pattern.
- **Confirmation:** A bearish confirmation is crucial after a Shooting Star. This could come in the form of a [[Bearish_Engulfing_Pattern]], a long black [[Marubozu]], or a gap down, solidifying the reversal.
