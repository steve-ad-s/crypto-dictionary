# Spinning Top

![[Figure 3.19 - Spinning Top.png]]

A Spinning Top is a single-candle pattern that indicates indecision in the market, similar to a Doji. It is characterized by a small real body, with long upper and lower shadows of similar length.

## Logical Behavior

The small real body of the Spinning Top shows that there was little difference between the opening and closing prices. However, the long upper and lower shadows indicate that both buyers and sellers were active during the session, pushing the price significantly up and down. Ultimately, neither side could gain the upper hand, and the close ended up very near the open. This represents a stalemate and a loss of momentum for the previously dominant group.

- **In an uptrend:** A Spinning Top suggests that the bulls are losing control and the trend could be nearing a top. The conviction that drove the price up is fading.
- **In a downtrend:** A Spinning Top implies that sellers are losing their grip and the downtrend may be coming to an end.
- **Confirmation is needed:** Like a Doji, a Spinning Top is a neutral pattern that signals indecision. Traders should wait for the next candle to confirm the direction of the next move. A break above the Spinning Top's high would suggest a bullish move, while a break below its low would suggest a bearish move.
- **In a trading range:** Spinning Tops are common in periods of consolidation or congestion and have less significance in these contexts.

## Conditions

1.  **Small real body:** The body should be small relative to the shadows.
2.  **Upper and lower shadows:** The candle should have distinct shadows on both ends.
3.  **Shadows are longer than the body:** The shadows should be noticeably longer than the real body.
4.  The color of the body is generally not important.

## Relationship - Candlestick

The Spinning Top is a pattern of indecision and often acts as a precursor to other patterns or a confirmation of a change in market sentiment.

- **Doji:** The Spinning Top is very similar in interpretation to a [[Doji]]. The main difference is that a Spinning Top has a small real body, whereas a Doji has virtually no body at all. Both signal indecision.
- **As part of larger patterns:** Spinning Tops can be the central candle in major reversal patterns like the [[Morning_Star]] and [[Evening_Star]]. The indecision represented by the Spinning Top is the key turning point between the bearish and bullish candles of these patterns.
- **Preceding strong moves:** Often, a period of consolidation marked by several Spinning Tops can precede a significant breakout or breakdown. They show pressure building up before a decisive move.
- **High-Wave Candle:** A Spinning Top with exceptionally long shadows is called a High-Wave candle, signifying a period of extreme volatility and uncertainty.
